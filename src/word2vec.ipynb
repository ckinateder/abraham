       "  'text': 'When iOS 14 launched, Apple announced a new Find My network accessory program designed for third-party accessory makers, and in April 2021, Apple launched the initiative.    With the Find My network accessory program, third-party accessory makers can add Find My integration to their devices, allowing products to be tracked in the Find My app right alongside Apple devices.  This guide covers everything that you need to know about the accessory program, from how it works to which devices offer Find My integration.  How Tracking Third-Party Accessories Works  Accessory makers that join Apple\\'s Made for iPhone program and participate in the Find My network accessory program can add Find My integration into any Bluetooth device.    That means that a Bluetooth or WiFi device with Find My compatibility can be tracked right in the Find My app alongside your Apple products. In iOS 14.3 or later, there\\'s an \"Items\" tab available in Find My, which is where all third-party accessories can be located.  Find My for third-party accessories works just like Find My for any of your Apple devices, with your accessories shown on a map. Third-party Find My accessories can take advantage of all of Apple\\'s Find My functionality.  So if a Bluetooth-equipped device is nearby, it will show up in the Find My app, but if it\\'s out of range, the map will show the last known location. If you lose an item and someone else with an \\u200ciPhone\\u200c, iPad, or Mac comes close to it, it can communicate with their device with the approximate location of the item relayed securely and privately back to you.  Setting Up Third-Party Find My Devices  The Find My app is the one-stop shop for adding, controlling, and locating any Find My-compatible accessory, as third-party accessories designed to work with Find My can\\'t support other apps or item location networks.  There\\'s an \"Items\" tab in the Find My app on \\u200ciPhone\\u200c, \\u200ciPad\\u200c, and Mac, and to add an item, you just tap on the \"Add Item\" option. You will need to follow the instructions from the device maker to put your Find My accessory into a pairing mode, and that will vary from manufacturer to manufacturer.    With VanMoof bikes, for example, you need to double press on the power button of the bike to put it into pairing mode to connect it to the Find My app.  You can give all of your items custom names and assign an emoji to them so you can identify each one at a glance on the Find My map. Adding an item to Find My does require your Apple ID, as it links that item to your ID.  Locating Lost Third-Party Devices With Find My  If you open up the Find My app and navigate to the Items tab, you can see all of your Find My-compatible accessories on a map. You\\'ll see current location if the accessory is able to communicate with your \\u200ciPhone\\u200c, \\u200ciPad\\u200c, or Mac over Bluetooth, or the last known location if it is too far away. It will also tell you the last time that your device communicated with the accessory.    You can play sounds on Find My accessories, and if lost, place them into a Lost Mode. Putting a device into Lost Mode allows you to lock it down to prevent it from being paired with another Apple device, and it adds a phone number and message in case anyone comes across your lost item.  If someone who has an \\u200ciPad\\u200c, \\u200ciPhone\\u200c, or Mac comes across your lost Find My accessory, they can use the Find My app to see your message and get in touch. You\\'ll also get a notification when it\\'s located through another person\\'s device, and its location will show up on the map.  The Find My network that allows lost devices to be found through crowdsourcing is anonymous and encrypted, so while you will get info on where your lost item might be, you won\\'t see who discovered it unless they contact you after you\\'ve provided a message and a phone number.  Putting an Item Into Lost Mode  You can put a lost item into Lost Mode by tapping on its name in Find My and then tapping \"Enable\" under Lost Mode. Apple prompts you to input a phone number where you can be reached, and you can also choose to get a notification when updated location information becomes available.    Lost Mode can be disabled by toggling off \"Enabled\" under the Lost Mode option.  Preventing Theft  Find My items are linked to your \\u200cApple ID\\u200c much like iPhones, iPads, and Macs. If someone steals an accessory with Find My built in, that person will not be able to link the item to their own \\u200cApple ID\\u200c account.  Getting Directions to a Lost Item  Tapping on any of your third-party accessories in the Find My app will show its last location. If it\\'s not close by, you can tap on \"Directions\" to open its location in the Apple Maps app to get directions from your current location to the location of your item.  Updating Items  Third-party accessories that connect to Find My can get firmware updates. To install an update, tap on the item\\'s name in the Find My app and then tap on \"Update Available.\" If no Update Available button is listed, then the item is up to date.  Check an Item\\'s Serial Number  Tapping on an item in the Find My app and then tapping on \"Show Details\" will let you see information like serial number or model number, and it will let you know if the manufacturer has an app available for you to download to add additional features to the item.  How to Identify Someone\\'s Lost Item  If you come across a lost item and you know that it has Find My integration, you can open up the Find My app and tap on the \"Identify Found Item\" option to see if the person who has lost it has left a message and a contact number so you can get in touch with them.  Scanning for lost items using the Find My app will take you to a website to see a Lost Mode message.  Unknown Item Safety Alerts  If Apple detects a Find My accessory that is on your person or moving with you, it will send you a safety alert. This is so you can make sure no one has planted a tracking device on you.  If you get one of these alerts, you can tap into it to see the unknown item on a map or play a sound. You can also tap \"Learn More About This Item\" to get details, such as serial number, and there is an option to disable the item so that it stops sharing your location. Tap on \"Instructions\" and then tap \"Disable Item\" to do this.  Note that if you have an item belonging to another person and disable location alerts, the item will not be usable to you because it is already linked to an \\u200cApple ID\\u200c.  There are instances where safety alerts can be inconvenient, such as if a family member nearby has a Find My item that your device is picking up. In this situation, you can turn off safety alerts for people in your Family Sharing group or tap on \"Pause Safety Alerts\" to mute them for the day.  Safety alerts can be turned off entirely as well if you\\'re getting an annoying number of notifications. Under the \"Me\" tab, go to Notifications and then toggle off Item Safety Alerts. This needs to be done on a per-device basis.  Removing an Item From Find My  If you want to sell or give away a Find My accessory, you need to remove it from Find My. Bring it near your device, tap \"Remove Item,\" and follow the instructions.  You can also remove an item from your account if it\\'s not nearby, but it will still be locked and won\\'t be able to be added to anyone\\'s account because of its link to your \\u200cApple ID\\u200c.  Third-Party Accessories That Support Find My  There are a limited number of Find My accessories available at the current time, but Apple expects more manufacturers to add Find My support in the future. Right now, all of the products below can be pre-ordered, but won\\'t be available for shipping until June or later.  Compatibility Requirements  Adding a compatible third-party accessory to the Find My app requires iOS 14.3 or later, iPadOS 14.3 or later, or macOS Big Sur 11.1 or later.'},\n",

       "  'text': \"Andrew Hoyle/CNET  It's been six months since the iPhone 12 went on sale, and Apple is setting its sights on its next flagship smartphone, the iPhone 13 (or whatever it ends up being called). We're expecting to see four versions of the new phone: the iPhone 13, the iPhone 13 Mini, the iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. But when can we expect Apple to unveil its newest phones?  Apple has yet to hint at any iPhone 13 event date (though there may be an Apple event this month, potentially to unveil the AirPods 3). Based on Apple's history, however, we can typically predict when the company's iPhone events will happen, and make an educated guess on a release date based on that.  While the pandemic changed the usual course for 2020, marking the first September Apple event in eight years without an iPhone due to production delays, Kuo predicts that 2021 will see a return to the company's typical cadence. A March 24 report based on supply chain information also points to a late September iPhone 13 release date. And an April report from DigiTimes cited industry insiders who said production for the phones' new chips is ahead of schedule, which should put the phone release back on a familiar, prepandemic timeline.  Read more: Every iPhone 13 rumor we've heard so far, including how much the iPhone 13 will cost  If all of this is true, we can expect to get a first look at the iPhone 13 at an event at some point in September.  Apple usually holds its events on Tuesdays or Wednesdays, and iPhone release dates typically are set about a week and a half after Apple announces the new devices. Usually, new iPhones are released on a Friday, around the third week of September.  Now playing: Watch this: iPhone 13 rumor roundup  A few years ago, CNET took a deep dive into the Apple event timeline and emerged with a compelling Labor Day hypothesis, which you can read about here. Based on the 2021 calendar, the Labor Day rule would put the September Apple event (and the unveiling of the iPhone 13) on Sept. 8, with a Sept. 17 release date.  We won't know if this is true until Apple announces an event, and shows off the phones. But if you want to plan ahead and save up for an iPhone 13, we'd bet on the September timeline, at least for now.

The Find My network accessory program opens up the vast and global Find My network to third-party device manufacturers to build products utilizing the service, so their customers can use the Find My app to locate and keep track of the important items in their lives. New products that work with the Find My app from Belkin, Chipolo, and VanMoof will be available beginning next week.  “For more than a decade, our customers have relied on Find My to locate their missing or stolen Apple devices, all while protecting their privacy,” said Bob Borchers, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing. “Now we’re bringing the powerful finding capabilities of Find My, one of our most popular services, to more people with the Find My network accessory program. We’re thrilled to see how Belkin, Chipolo, and VanMoof are utilizing this technology, and can’t wait to see what other partners create.”  The Find My Network Accessory Program  Part of the Made for iPhone (MFi) Program, the Find My network accessory program is designed for any accessory developer looking to connect an existing or new product to the Find My network. Third-party products must adhere to all the privacy protections of the Find My network that Apple customers rely on. Approved products can be added to the new Items tab and will feature a “Works with Apple Find My” badge to clearly communicate to users that the product is compatible with the Find My network and the Find My app.1  Today Apple is also announcing a draft specification for chipset manufacturers that will be released later this spring.

       "  'text': 'Compared to 2020, 2021 has been a wasteland for new Apple products. Over the final three months of 2020, Apple launched the Apple Watch SE and Series 6, the iPad Air, HomePod mini, iPhone 12 series, and M1 Macs, along with a surprise December AirPods Max launch. We naturally assumed the pace would continue into the new year, with rumors swirling about new AirPods, iPads, AirTags, Apple TV, and iMacs all launching in early 2021.  We haven’t gotten any of them. The rumors of a March event never came to pass and now we’re hearing that there probably won’t be one in April either. In fact, Apple has never waited this long into the new year to announce a new product. It’s the first time since 2014 that it hasn’t launched a new iPad in March (though it landed on April 1 that year), and you need to go back to 2013 to find a year without the launch of a significant new product or update. And out of all those new products we were expecting, only iPads appear to be on the way, possibly as soon as this week.  So what gives? Is Apple just building anticipation for the new things that we all know are on the way? Not exactly. Though hype might be part of it, there are much bigger forces that are keeping Apple’s products at bay for just a little longer. And they could end up affecting every product Apple is planning on releasing this year, including the iPhone 13.  Production woes  A report in Nikkei Asia Thursday confirmed that a worldwide supply crunch has caused production delays in MacBooks and iPads, two devices that should have been shipping soon. In particular, “a shortage of displays and display components” have affected iPad production, while MacBooks were hit with a more specific problem concerning “the mounting of components on printed circuit boards before final assembly.”  Chip shortages could have a major impact on Apple’s 2021 roadmap. Apple  According to the report, Apple pushed both products, which were scheduled to ship in the first half of 2021, to the second half of the year. Most likely, the products in question are the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBooks and the 9.7-inch iPad, but it’s almost certain that the delays affecting these models have also impacted the rest of the products due to arrive in 2021, including the iPad Pros that are rumored to arrive next week.  And that’s to speak nothing of chip shortages, which have been a worldwide problem for many months, affecting everything from graphics cards to cars to Android smartphones. This is the first report we’ve read about it affecting Apple, but the company has no doubt felt the impacts for months. First, Apple’s fall product lineup was shifted from its usual schedule. Then the iPhone arrived more than a month later than usual. And finally, the AirPods Max sold out instantly and were back-ordered for months.  A report from Bloomberg claims the new iPad Pro might be constrained as well. According to Mark Gurman, Apple’s overseas suppliers are dealing with poor manufacturing yields for the new mini LED display, which will reportedly be one of the device’s key upgrades. He said “at least one of the MiniLED makers has had to recently pause production as a result. Add that to the supply constraints, and shipments of the new iPad Pro, Apple’s first new product of 2021, could be delayed by several weeks.  Those aren’t out of the realm of the normal Apple delays, but it was definitely a sign that things were definitely getting backed up. And now that the chip shortage has gotten even tighter, we’re seeing longer and more noticeable delays. The supply crunch was exacerbated by the Ever Given cargo ship that got stuck in the Suez Canal and disrupted the supply chain even further. To put it mildly, the production issues Apple is facing could get a whole worse.  Events in flux  We’ll never know for sure if Apple was planning on holding a March event, but if it was, the fact that it would have been virtual gave them some valuable flexibility. It’s entirely possible that there’s a video keynote at Apple Park that simply won’t see the light of day because the products that were supposed to be unveiled aren’t ready.  WWDC will be virtual again and could be the first Apple event of the year. Apple  The virtual events also let Apple space things out to generate maximum visibility. In a normal year, Apple would never have held three events last fall, but with online keynotes, events can be scheduled at a moment’s notice, shifted on a dime, scheduled and re-scheduled when things are ready. In previous years, Apple might have held an event and shipped products weeks later, but now it can wait as long as it has to.  Waiting also helps build anticipation, which is something of a double-edged sword. The more people wait, the higher expectations get and the easier it is to be let down. There’s a reason why Apple likes to space out its product launches and if new iPads arrive next week, my guess is there won’t be man event until WWDC.  All eyes on iPhone  Nikkei Asia reports that iPhones “have so far not been affected by the supply shortage,” but it also says supplies of some components are “quite tight.” That could mean another October launch for the iPhone 13, with staggered shipments to help ease the supply constraints.  We probably won’t see Tim Cook live on stage for at least another year. Apple  But it could also be much worse. There are no signs that the chip shortage is getting any better —GM and Ford just halted production at several factories due to chip shortages and it appears as though Google has canceled the Pixel 5a for the same reason—so Apple might need to prioritize the A15 chips in the iPhone 13 to salvage the holiday quarter. That could mean some M1 Macs that were due to arrive in 2021 get pushed to 2022 as well as other products.  So while we’ve never had to wait this long for a new or refreshed Apple device, it looks like new iPads will be arriving very soon. However, the wait for the next one might be a whole lot longer.'},\n",

This year’s conference will include announcements from the keynote and State of the Union stages, online sessions, 1:1 labs offering technical guidance, and new ways for developers to interact with Apple engineers and designers to learn about the latest frameworks and technologies.  Apple will continue its long-standing tradition of supporting students who love to code with this year’s Swift Student Challenge, inviting them to create an interactive scene in a Swift playground that can be experienced within three minutes. Swift Playgrounds is a revolutionary app for iPad and Mac that makes learning the Swift programming language interactive and fun. Now through April 18, students can submit their Swift playground to the Swift Student Challenge. Winners will receive exclusive WWDC21 outerwear and a pin set. For more information, visit the Swift Student Challenge website  To support the local economy, even while WWDC21 is hosted online and as part of its $100 million Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, Apple is also committing $1 million to SJ Aspires, an education and equity initiative launched by the City of San José. Focused on enabling youth in underserved neighborhoods to set goals and chart a path toward receiving a college education, SJ Aspires offers a performance-based scholarship program that educates students about their college and career choices, and provides individual mentorship and advising as well as online tools to help reduce the barriers Black and Brown students face in accessing academic opportunities. This builds on Apple’s multiyear partnership with the City of San José and the San José Public Library Foundation in support of technology programming.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Apple generates a lot of news, and it can be hard to keep up. If your mind was on other things this week, our roundup of Apple-related headlines will bring you up to date.  If you\\'d like to get regular roundups, sign up to our newsletters. You can also follow us on Twitter for breaking news stories.  Spring is cancelled  Given the unflagging interest of the media and general public, I sometimes wonder why Apple doesn\\'t hold a press event every month. Let\\'s be honest, we\\'d still watch even if it was just Craig Federighi making humorous observations about airline food in front of a brick wall.  Perhaps 12 events a year would be pushing it. But we\\'ve heard nothing since December and the unreleased products are piling up - and yet it\\'s looking increasingly likely that there won\\'t be a spring event this year.  Sources this week claimed that a new iPad Pro will launch on 13 April, but there won\\'t be an event to announce it. Presumably Apple will send out a discreet press release and we\\'ll all go about our day.  The iPad Pro was only one of the new products expected to launch at an event in April, of course (the other obvious candidates are a new Apple TV and the AirTags object tracker - we think the new AirPods will have to wait until the autumn), but it would now be extremely odd if Apple holds an event for those other items and didn\\'t think to roll the new iPad into the same presentation.  Maybe the new stuff simply isn\\'t exciting enough? Cynics might point out that such considerations never stopped Apple in the past, but that would be a little unfair. And based on leaked photos of updated iPad dummies, there isn\\'t much to write home about in terms of exterior changes.  Image courtesy of Sonny Dickson  Adding to the confusion, Apple did do a small announcement this week, and it too undercut the portfolio of products we thought would be announced at a proper event. The company announced that its Find My app will soon work with third-party object trackers... so who needs an AirTag?  Maybe Apple will yet surprise us, and a late-April event could focus on the next iMac, for example. But I\\'m starting to suspect that we might not see Tim Cook on the virtual stage until WWDC in June.  Tim Cook\\'s 10-year plan  Talking of Tim Cook, a big podcast interview was released this week with Apple\\'s likeable and famously hard-working CEO. As ever the nuance of his wide-ranging comments was lost in the excitement of the headline soundbite, so let\\'s get this out of the way: Cook doesn\\'t think he\\'ll still be Apple boss in ten years\\' time.  Upon a moment\\'s reflection that doesn\\'t seem especially surprising. Cook will be 70 at that point; he\\'s been doing this for nearly a decade already; and the pace at which he works is unrelenting, and the pressure intense. Remember too that he isn\\'t a founder running on passion, but a logistics man brought in to keep the ship steady. Call me a quitter but I don\\'t want to be writing Apple Breakfast when I\\'m 70.  (As an aside, our colleagues on Macworld US this week asked readers to vote on who should be Apple\\'s CEO when Cook finally stands down. The results will shock you!)  Anyway, aside from the news that Tim Cook doesn\\'t plan on doing this forever, the key takeaways from the interview are his obvious interest in AR and autonomous vehicles, and his instinctive reticence when discussing Apple\\'s plans in those areas. \"We\\'ll see what Apple does,\" he said unyieldingly in response to a question about the Apple Car.  Batting questions away must get tiring after a while, and who could blame him for making (distant) retirement plans.  Apple facing legal heat  Troubling news for Apple this week on the legal front, as the judge presiding over the \\'Flexgate\\' class-action lawsuit appeared to agree with one of the plaintiffs\\' most salient arguments. Judge Edward Davila sided with dissatisfied MacBook owners who claimed Apple must have known about the fault with their laptops, and carried on selling them anyway.  This all stems from a display problem that afflicted MacBook Pros made between late 2016 and early 2018, whereby the backlights of some units stopped working entirely, while others experienced unwanted bright areas along the lower edge of the screen. It turned out that the problem was caused by a flex cable that was slightly too short (hence the name) but Apple didn\\'t acknowledge this for a long time - and the firm may now be punished for its response.  While we\\'re on the legal beat, the dispute with Epic Games continues, and Apple got its chance this week to make some arguments of its own.  According to lengthy internal documents presented by Cupertino lawyers, Epic hatched a plan to attack Apple (and Google) as early as 2008, under a scheme later known as Project Liberty. If true, this would prove two things: that Fortnite being kicked out of the App Store was a convenient pretext rather than the real reason behind the two firms\\' animosity; and that tech companies have never-ending supplies of pomposity and self-regard.  \"Project Liberty.\" I bet Laurence Fox wishes he thought of that one.  News in brief  This could be a great year for Apple. An analyst has predicted that the company will sell up to 250 million iPhones in 2021, beating its 2015 record. (Perhaps it could improve sales by not making an iPhone 13 mini.)  Because key components are soldered directly to the motherboard, it was thought impossible to replace the RAM and storage of an M1 Mac. But a Chinese engineer has proved that it can be done. It sounds risky, and we wouldn\\'t recommend you try it at home.  Snap, the owner of Snapchat, has reportedly been looking at ways to bypass Apple\\'s new privacy rules.  A whopping 9 out of 10 iPhone users are running iOS 14, giving another demonstration of Apple\\'s astonishing ability to herd its user base on to a consistent platform. (Those software nags probably help.)  Forget Hey Siri. You\\'ll soon be able to say \"Hey Spotify\" to trigger that service on your iPhone - and some users already can.  Bugs & problems  The production of new iPads and Macs has been delayed as a result of worldwide chip shortages, reports Nikkei.  The rumour mill  A mysterious tweet from a usually reliable leaker has sparked a rumour that the next iMac will have the biggest screen yet. The leaker then appeared to claim the whole thing was a joke, but the last time they walked back a prediction it turned out to be completely accurate.  You\\'d be forgiven for feeling confused about the iPhone 13\\'s notch - some say it\\'s staying, some that it\\'s going, and others that it\\'s changing size. And even that last group are split between the ones who say it\\'s getting narrower and those who say it\\'s getting shorter.  The latest leak, confusingly, says it will be significantly narrower but a tiny bit taller. We\\'re talking half a millimetre, so try not to fret.  As for the iPhone 13\\'s A15 processor, we don\\'t know much about the technical details, but we do know it\\'s happening. Supply-chain sources expect the chip to go into mass production as early as next month.  We\\'ve got yet another clue that there will be a new Apple TV soon. This time code in the latest tvOS beta indicates that a 120Hz model is coming.  There\\'s a giant iPhone SE in the works, but it won\\'t launch until 2023.  Patent activity suggests that future iPhones and Apple Watches could remind you to charge them.  Apple has also patented a keyboard-free MacBook. What an idea!  And that\\'s it for this week. Stay Appley!'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Bloomberg  (Bloomberg) -- Bond traders searching for a chink in the armor of central banks are starting to look Down Under, where a likely showdown over yield-curve control is set to test the power of policy makers to contain the next wave of reflation bets.The global trading day for bonds begins in earnest in Sydney each morning, giving developments in Australia’s $600 billion sovereign debt market an out-sized impact on sentiment. It was the scene of a dramatic “flash crash” last year when the yield program was announced, illustrating the potential for turmoil.While the Reserve Bank of Australia has largely tamed markets since then, as the economy’s recovery strengthens, wagers against the RBA’s ability to keep yields lower look poised to rise.“If inflation expectations do start to un-anchor, then I think the RBA will be one of the first central banks to be tested by bond traders,” said Shaun Roache, an economist at S&P Global Ratings in Singapore. “The RBA is a canary in the coalmine for central banks as it is ahead in its labor market recovery.”The RBA brought short-sellers quickly to heel when the global bond rout emboldened them to test its grip on yield control in February. After weeks of aggressive positioning by traders, the bank nudged up the cost of speculating on rising rates and the yield on benchmark three-year bonds fell neatly back into line with its 0.1% target.But keeping the market at bay next time may prove more difficult, as vaccination campaigns gather pace in major economies and the U.S. recovery nears an “inflection point,” emboldening traders.If yield control fails in Australia, it may fade away as a potential option for other monetary authorities in need of more policy ammunition. Especially because yield control’s record in Japan -- the only other country to officially employ it -- is patchy.Pinning the rate of one key bond maturity has helped the Bank of Japan reduce borrowing costs in general and also allowed it to slow the pace of bond purchases. But it has come at a cost. The nation’s debt market is lambasted as dysfunctional and an economic recovery strong enough to revive inflation looks as far away as ever.Widening GapBeneath the surface, problems appear to be building Down Under too. While the RBA has its thumb on one specific bond line, there is a large gulf between the yield on this security and those maturing slightly later. There’s also a widening gap to rates on the suite of derivatives linked to three-year yields that flow through into borrowing costs for companies and consumers.Take Australia’s three-year swap rate, an important tool for corporate borrowers to manage interest-rate risks. It surged through February and March, rising to four times the RBA’s target for three-year bonds amid pressure from higher U.S. yields and a rebounding economy at home.Australia’s bond futures tell a similar story. The yield implied by three-year futures doubled in the two weeks to Feb. 26 and remains elevated, even after retreating from its high point.“Lack of liquidity, a central bank that’s digging its heels in -- all that, for us, means there’s going to be more volatility in Aussie rates,” said Kellie Wood, a fixed-income portfolio manager at Schroders Plc’s Australian unit. “The RBA has succeeded in terms of round one. But we are starting to see cracks,” said Wood, who expects the market to challenge the 0.1% target again.Stephen Miller, an investment consultant at GSFM, an arm of Canada’s CI Financial Corp., agrees that higher yields may arrive in Australia sooner than the RBA thinks. “It will be powerless if the U.S. curve shifts upwards and other rates markets follow,” said Miller.Not everyone is prepared to bet against the RBA.For Fidelity International’s Anthony Doyle, taking on the RBA may be a recipe for steep losses if past lessons from the European Central Bank and U.S. Federal Reserve are anything to go by.Nine years ago, then ECB President Mario Draghi vowed to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro, leading to quantitative easing and bond purchases that are still in place. The Fed said more than a year ago that it would buy unlimited amounts of Treasuries to keep borrowing costs at rock-bottom levels, and it’s still holding firm.“I don’t think it’s ever wise to fight anyone that has a printing press,” said Doyle, a cross-asset investment specialist at Fidelity in Sydney. “The RBA as a house holds all the cards. If they want yields lower, they’ll get it.”Yet Governor Philip Lowe isn’t doing everything he could to damp doubts over the RBA’s resolve. His reluctance to make an early switch in the yield target to bonds maturing in November 2024, from ones due in April 2024, is fueling debate about how soon the policy could be wound back.Lowe said at the conclusion of the latest board meeting on April 6 that a decision would be made later this year, without being more specific. He also indicated that the RBA expected to maintain “highly supportive monetary conditions” until at least 2024, even though the number of Australians with a job has returned to pre-pandemic levels.“We don’t think they’ll extend yield-curve control” beyond the current April 2024 bond, said Wood, who warned of potential taper tantrums.Lowe’s February win against short sellers, and a slide in yields at home and abroad over recent weeks, has given the RBA space to breathe. But it’s likely only a matter of time before bond traders come back for round two.“Everybody’s watching how this is going to unfold,” said S&P’s Roache. “The RBA may not want this role, but it is taking quite a starring role I think among global central banks.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.'},\n",

       "  'text': \"Patrick Holland/CNET  The next time you open the Find My app on your iPhone, iPad or Mac, you're going to notice a new Items tab along the bottom of the screen. Apple recently announced a new feature that allows other companies to use Apple's Find My network to find devices. That means you'll soon be able to buy a Tile-like device, wireless earbuds or even an electric bike that can be tracked using Apple's Find My app.  To be clear, the Find My app will still help you track down your lost iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch or AirPods, but the list of devices and products you can track is growing.  Below I'll walk you through the Find My app, and detail how Apple's approach keeps your data and information private.  Jason Cipriani/CNET  Find your Apple devices and friends    The Find My app now has four main tabs: People, Devices, Items and Me. I'll dive into the Items tab in the section below, but for now I want to focus on finding people, your Apple devices and Me sections of the app.  The People tab is where you'll find contacts that you have shared your location with. Or if you're part of a Family Sharing group, everyone in your family group will show up here as well. A map takes up most of the screen, with a list of your contacts down below. Tap on a contact to zoom in on their location and view options such as getting directions to them or creating a notification.  Notifications can be useful if you want to know when a friend leaves or arrives at a location. Your contact will receive an alert whenever you create a notification related to their location, letting them know you'll receive an alert when their location changes -- no more staying up to date about their location without them knowing (and that's a good thing).  The Devices tab lists all of the Apple devices signed into your iCloud account, as well as any devices attached to your Family Sharing group, say your spouse's, parents' or kids'. You can view all of them on a map, or tap on an individual device for information. Each device listing will include the last time the device was located, its current battery level, a button to get directions to the iPhone or play a sound to help find a misplaced device. You can also mark the device as lost, activating Lost Mode, to help in its recovery.  Finally, the Me tab is where you'll find options to stop sharing your location with your friends, edit the name of a location (label your home, work, etc.), and turn friend requests on or off. A new option that's been added to the Me tab is Item Safety Alerts. When turned on, your iPhone will alert you when an unknown device is nearby and moving with you. For example, if someone were to secretly put a Chipolo One Spot tag in your bag so they could track your location at all times, your iPhone will notify you.  Apple  Find My's new Items tab  Your Apple device will need to be running iOS 14.3, iPadOS 14.3 or MacOS Big Sur 11.1 or newer in order for you to see the Items tab and connect third-party products to the app. Currently, there are only three announced products that will work with the Find My network, but Apple expects to see more products in the coming weeks and months.  The current list of products and expected availability are:  Belkin's will ship in June, but you can order a pair right now.    Andy of VanMoof's ordered after April 7 will work with Apple's Find My network. Shipping time ranges from 9 to 20 weeks, depending on the configuration.    Chipolo's isn't available for preorder, but it will start shipping in June. You can, however, sign up for alerts when preorders open up.    I'm waiting to get my hands on any one of the new products to test and figure out exactly how the Find My Items feature will work. However, I believe you'll start by turning on the product, then opening the Items tab in the Find My app while your Apple device looks for available devices. You'll then follow prompts to like the item to your Apple ID, after which it will show up in the Items tab. You can then play a sound if it's nearby, turn on Lost Mode and get alerts when it's found.  Apple  How Find My works, even when your lost item is offline  The most notable aspect of the Find My app and the network it uses is how Apple locates a lost device, even if it's offline. As long as your iPhone or other compatible product is powered on, it can be found by nearby Apple devices, even if a thief has turned off all internet connectivity.  Using your lost device's Bluetooth signal, nearby iPhones, iPads and Macs will report the exact location of the lost gadget back to Apple. You'll then receive an alert where the device is located -- all anonymously, encrypted, and without any interaction by those who are near your lost device.  Let's say you leave your iPad in an airport and once you realize it's gone, you mark it as lost in the Find My app. As other iPhone owners walk past your lost iPad and their phone will identify its Bluetooth signal as linked to a lost device, then send you an alert with your iPad's location, all without that person ever knowing your iPad was lost or having to interact with their phone at all.  Apple is essentially turning all of its hardware into anonymous search parties, and it's pretty darn cool.  If you're worried about privacy concerns, all of this is done through end-to-end encryption, which according to Apple, prevents anyone, even the company itself, from seeing your item's location.  Curious how other features on your iPhone or iPad work? Here's how Apple's Face ID works. We also have several guides for iOS 14, including the best features you should know about, along with hidden features you'll love.\"},\n",

FILE PHOTO: A Tesla car is seen in Los Angeles, California, U.S., July 9, 2020. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson  Canaccord Genuity analyst Jed Dorsheimer upgraded Tesla to “buy” from “hold” and increased his price target to $1,071, the second highest among 37 analysts tracked by Refinitiv.  The company run by Elon Musk last traded at $697.  “TSLA is rapidly creating an Apple-esque ecosystem of energy products, harmonized in electrification, to become The Brand in energy storage,” Dorsheimer wrote in a client note focused on Tesla’s battery technology and residential energy products.  He compared the brand Tesla has built around its battery technology to Apple’s wildly successful “Think Different” marketing campaign launched in the 1990s.  The latest bump in Tesla’s stock leaves it down about 1% for the year as investors await its quarterly results due in two weeks.  Last week, Tesla posted record quarterly deliveries amid strong demand in China, beating analysts’ expectations.  Tesla’s stock remains up over 500% in the past 12 months, and its $668 billion market capitalization makes it by far the most valuable carmaker, even though its production is a fraction of rivals such as Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co.  When it reports its March quarter results on April 26, analysts, on average, expect a 70% jump in revenue to $10.2 billion, and net income of $504 million, up from $16 million a year ago, according to Refinitiv.

The app was a fake, designed to trick people into thinking it was a legitimate app.  But Christodoulou is angrier at Apple than at the thieves themselves: He says Apple marketed the App Store as a safe and trusted place, where each app is reviewed before it is allowed in the store.  Story continues below advertisement  Christodoulou, once a loyal Apple customer, said he no longer admires the company. “They betrayed the trust that I had in them,” he said in an interview. “Apple doesn’t deserve to get away with this.”  Advertisement  Apple bills its App Store as “the world’s most trusted marketplace for apps,” where every submission is scanned and reviewed, ensuring they are safe, secure, useful and unique. But in fact, it’s easy for scammers to circumvent Apple’s rules, according to experts. Criminal app developers can break Apple’s rules by submitting seemingly innocuous apps for approval and then transforming them into phishing apps that trick people into giving up their information, according to Apple. When Apple finds out, it removes the apps and bans the developers, the company says. But it’s too late for the people who fell for the scam.  Crypto scams are also common on Google’s Android and on the Web. But their presence on the Apple App Store is more surprising because Apple says it curates the store and checks each app, which creates high levels of consumer trust. The 15 to 30 percent commission Apple collects on all sales on the App Store goes to fund the “highly curated” customer experience, the company has said.  Story continues below advertisement  “User trust is at the foundation of why we created the App Store, and we have only deepened that commitment in the years since,” said Apple spokesperson Fred Sainz. “Study after study has shown that the App Store is the most secure app marketplace in the world, and we are constantly at work to maintain that standard and to further strengthen the App Store’s protections. In the limited instances when criminals defraud our users, we take swift action against these actors as well as to prevent similar violations in the future.”  Advertisement  The ability of apps to morph into something else entirely after they are approved by the App Store raises questions about the effectiveness of Apple’s review process to stop scammers. Apple wouldn’t say how often these scams appear, or how often it removes them. But it did say it removed 6,500 apps for “hidden or undocumented features” last year. Apple touts user safety as its defense against accusations from lawmakers, regulators and competitors that the company uses its monopoly over app distribution on iPhones anti-competitively.  “Apple frequently pushes myths about user privacy and security as a shield against its anti-competitive App Store practices,” said Meghan DiMuzio, executive director of the Coalition for App Fairness, which was formed to fight Apple’s power over its App Store. “The truth is, Apple’s security ‘standards’ are inconsistently applied across apps and only enforced when it benefits Apple.”  Apple acknowledged there have been other cryptocurrency scams on the App Store but wouldn’t say how many. Apple wouldn’t say whether fake Trezor apps had sneaked into the App Store in the past, or whether new apps called “Trezor” will be flagged as potentially fraudulent in the future.  Advertisement  Story continues below advertisement  Coinfirm, a U.K.-based company that specializes in cryptocurrency regulations and conducts fraud investigations, says it has received more than 7,000 inquiries about stolen crypto assets since October 2019. Fake apps in Google’s Android Play Store and Apple’s App Store are common, said Pawel Aleksander, the company’s chief information officer.  Coinfirm said five people have reported having cryptocurrency stolen by the fake Trezor app on iOS, for total losses worth $1.6 million. There have been three reports of fake Trezor apps on Android that stole a total of $600,000 in cryptocurrency.  Apple would not name the developer of the fake Trezor app or provide the developer’s contact information. Apple wouldn’t say whether it was turning over the name to law enforcement or whether it investigated the developer further. Apple also wouldn’t say whether that developer had developed any other apps in the past or had connections to other developer accounts under different names.  Advertisement  Story continues below advertisement  “We don’t allow apps that mislead users by impersonating another app, developer or company, and when we discover an app that violates our policies, we take appropriate action,” said Google spokesperson Colin Smith.  Google said it knows of two fake Trezor apps that have appeared on the Google Play store. It removed both. It didn’t say how the Trezor apps made it onto the store. The company didn’t say whether it notified law enforcement, or how many other scam apps it has found on the store. It didn’t say whether it investigated the developers. Analytics firm App Figures was able to find eight fake Trezor apps that have appeared on the Play Store.  Of all the Internet scams, the theft of cryptocurrency is one of the most lucrative for thieves. Millions of dollars in digital currency can be pilfered in a split-second, and high-profile crypto heists have netted thieves as much as $530 million, which occurred in the Coincheck hack in 2018. In 2014, Apple banned crypto wallets on the App Store but then restored them the same year. Apple does not allow cryptocurrency mining apps, and it places extra restrictions on crypto wallet apps.  To better secure their investments, people who own cryptocurrencies transfer their investments to “hardware wallets,” which are like USB thumb drives that store the secret and sensitive information a thief would need to steal someone’s cryptocurrency.  Advertisement  Story continues below advertisement  Hardware wallets plug into a computer via a USB connection. By typing in a PIN and sometimes an additional passphrase, the hardware wallet can be accessed and used to make transactions. If a hardware wallet is lost or destroyed, the information can be restored with a secret “seed phrase.” Some people keep the seed phrase in a safe-deposit box, hoping they’ll never have to use it, or etched on durable metal that can survive a fire. Scammers use phishing to trick people into giving up their seed phrases.  Trezor, based in the Czech Republic and owned by a company called Satoshi Labs, is a well-known maker of hardware wallets. Trezor doesn’t have a mobile app, but crypto thieves created a fake one and put it on Apple’s App Store in January and the Google Play Store in December, according to those companies, tricking some unsuspecting Trezor customers into entering their seed phrases.  Kristyna Mazankova, a spokeswoman for Trezor, said the company has been notifying Apple and Google for years about fake apps posing as a Trezor product to scam its customers. Trezor has never had a mobile app, though the company is working on one. She said the process of reporting the apps is “painful” and that representatives of Apple and Google haven’t been in contact.  Advertisement  Story continues below advertisement  Mazankova said Trezor notified Apple about a copycat app on Feb 1. Apple removed the app on Feb. 3, but it appeared again days later, according to Christodoulou, before it was removed again.  The fake Trezor app got through the app store through a bait-and-switch, according to Apple. Though it was called Trezor and used the Trezor logo and colors, it represented itself as a “cryptography” app that would encrypt iPhone files and store passwords, according to Apple. The developer of the fake Trezor app told Apple’s review team it “is not involved in any cryptocurrency.” Apple approved the app and it appeared in the App Store on Jan. 22, according to mobile analytics firm Sensor Tower.  Some time later, unbeknown to Apple, the Trezor cryptography app changed itself into a cryptocurrency wallet. Apple does not allow these sorts of changes, but Apple says it does not know when they occur. It relies on users and customers to report it when it happens, the company said.  Advertisement  Story continues below advertisement  After Trezor reported the fake app to Apple, Apple says it removed the app and banned the developer. Two days later, another fake Trezor app appeared. Apple removed that app, too. Apple did not say how it found out about the fake apps, but said it removed them because they were fraudulent.  Sensor Tower said the Trezor app was on the Apple App Store from at least Jan. 22 to Feb. 3 and appears to have been downloaded about 1,000 times. The app was downloaded about 1,000 times on Android, but Sensor Tower did not collect data on exactly when it became available.  James Fajcz, a reliability engineer at a paper company who lives in Savannah, Ga., also had his cryptocurrency stolen by the fake Trezor app, he says. In December, as he saw prices of the digital tokens rising, he purchased about $14,000 worth of Ethereum and bitcoin on Coinbase and Binance with money from his savings.  Advertisement  Story continues below advertisement  He wanted to make sure his investment was secure, so he purchased a Trezor Model T hardware wallet and downloaded an app on his iPhone called Trezor, which asked for his seed phrase. The app didn’t connect to his Trezor wallet, and he figured it didn’t work.  Weeks later, he purchased more Ethereum on Coinbase. He plugged in his Trezor device, but nothing was there. He went on the Trezor support forum on Reddit for answers. A Reddit poster informed him: There is no Trezor app. “My jaw dropped to the floor. My heart sank,” he said. “I realized what I did.”  Fajcz said he called Apple’s support line. An Apple representative said the company was not responsible, Fajcz says. “This was a trusted app on the App Store claiming to be the best and most trusted app store on any system anywhere,” he said. “And this nefarious app gets on the platform? I feel Apple should be held partially or fully responsible for that.”  Over a few years, Christodoulou had amassed 18.1 bitcoin. At the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, each was worth about $5,500. By October, the price was starting to skyrocket, topping out at $60,000 early this year.  Christodoulou had hoped his bitcoin holdings would help save his dry-cleaning business, which was decimated during the pandemic. On Feb. 1, he wanted to be able to check his bitcoin balance using his phone, instead of a computer. So he checked the App Store, downloaded the fake Trezor app and entered his seed phrase.  Immediately afterward, he plugged his Trezor hardware wallet into his computer and logged in to check his balance. It was all gone.  That evening, Christodoulou went into the App Store again to look more closely at the reviews. Before it was removed, the Trezor app had 155 reviews on the App Store for a rating of close to five stars, according to App Figures, the analytics firm. When Christodoulou opened up the written reviews, he read complaints from other people who had been scammed in the same way. The five-star ratings that helped make the app seem legitimate must have been fake, he concluded.  Christodoulou called Apple customer support and a representative said he would escalate it to a supervisor. He said he also notified Apple and filed a report with the FBI. Lauren Hagee Glintz, an FBI spokeswoman, declined to comment on the report.  Chainalysis, a commercial blockchain analysis firm, reviewed documents provided by Fajcz and Christodoulou and confirmed that their cryptocurrency was moved from their wallets to a suspicious account. Both thefts appeared related, said Madeleine Kennedy, a spokeswoman for Chainalysis. “There’s evidence this is a substantial scam bringing in hundreds of thousands of dollars,” she said.  Only one of Christodoulou’s 18.1 bitcoin was spared because he transferred it to a bitcoin savings service called BlockFi. At the time of the theft, his 17.1 stolen bitcoin were worth $600,000, but they soon went up in value to $1 million.  Christodoulou says he’s taking medication and seeing a psychiatrist. “It broke me. I’m still not recovered from it,” he said.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'This article is sponsored by the Post-IDFA Alliance, including Chartboost, Fyber, InMobi, Liftoff, Singular, Adcolony and Vungle.  When it comes to the impending App Tracking and Transparency (ATT) framework that is included in the iOS 14.5 update, everyone has their own opinion. There are those who believe Apple has truly altruistic motives to deliver greater privacy and stronger consumer protections to the iOS ecosystem. While others speculate that the move is a carefully orchestrated power play designed to strengthen Apple’s position with its consumers and weaken the advertising abilities of companies like Facebook and Google.  Regardless of where you fall on that spectrum, these changes are coming. As the owner of the iOS ecosystem, Apple has stated the new rules: iOS users should control whether or not their devices can be uniquely identified across companies for advertising purposes. These rules are expressed as the ATT framework, and they apply to everyone that uses iOS 14.5 and beyond.  In practice, ATT will drastically limit the usage of traditional mobile ad attribution, as most users are expected to decline consent to IDFA. To make up for this, Apple introduced a privacy-first, ATT-compliant attribution method called SKAdNetwork (SKAN). SKAN’s privacy-compliance, however, comes with a trade-off: data sparsity. Unlike traditional attribution methods, SKAN aggressively limits the amount of information that is associated with advertising campaigns.  For advertisers and DSPs, these impending changes leave us with two choices: We can try to explore temporary workarounds of Apple’s ATT framework, or adopt SKAN and evolve in lockstep with the increasingly privacy-conscious world.  As Forbes and others reported recently, however, one of these options isn’t an option at all. Apple has already begun to reject app updates that seek to circumvent the upcoming iOS privacy policy by creating unique identifiers that enable device fingerprinting. Combined with growing consumer awareness of data practices and support for data protection, it’s becoming increasingly clear that a privacy-first approach in advertising is the way of the future, and that the most future-proof approach to advertising in iOS is to adopt SKAN to be compliant with Apple’s ATT guidelines. With this in mind, here’s what you can do today to set your iOS campaigns up for success:  1. Reformulate campaign goals and target events. It is critical that you select conversion values that happen early and frequently in the customer journey, and that they correlate with high-value actions down the funnel. This maximizes the number of events you can capture in SKAN’s 24-hour timer, which in turn maximizes the volume of training data for the bidding algorithms that are utilized by demand-side platforms (DSPs).  So how do you go about finding the right conversion values? Start simple. To begin, find an upper-funnel, frequently occurring event that correlates with a valuable downstream event, such as a purchase, to validate that the data pipeline for campaign reporting and optimization is working as expected. You can implement more complex schemas once you validate that the basics work.  2. Verify that your demand partners are ready for SKAN. Make sure you can see SKAdnetwork conversions in the MMP dashboard. Or check if your demand partner can forward those postbacks directly to you. That is a good indication that your demand partner is mechanically ready for SKAN and is able to bid on SKAN-compatible inventory, get attribution from Apple and report on it.  Once SKAN reporting is established, consider doing a deeper analysis. Compare SKAN vs. MMP postbacks on SKAN-enabled inventory to get an idea for how the two attribution methods stack up against one another. Furthermore, for each of your iOS campaigns, understand what percentage of impressions bought today are SKAN-compatible and how that changes over time. Understanding your unique inventory ratio can help project changes in campaign scale when iOS 14.5 officially launches.  3. Develop a transition plan. As soon as iOS 14.5 launches, inventory on iOS 14.5 devices will be subjected to the ATT framework, and it will need to use SKAdnetwork for attribution. However, because it takes time for everyone to upgrade to the latest version, there will be a significant – albeit declining – amount of traffic that is still eligible for MMP attribution. Consider asking your demand partners about how they are planning to transition your campaigns and maximize performance and scale, while adhering to the new ATT constraints. Specifically, are they planning to create dedicated campaigns for each type of iOS inventory and how will that impact budget? Being on the same page with your vendor about the finer details of your ramp-up strategy will ensure your campaigns hit the ground running as soon as SKAN becomes the standard.

       "  'text': \"In a few months, Tim Cook will celebrate his 10th anniversary serving as Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO. Steve Jobs had stepped down back in August 2011 due to ongoing health struggles, naming Cook as his successor. Jobs would die just a few months later, losing a protracted battle with pancreatic cancer. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Cook (who turned 60 last year) acknowledged that he would probably not be Apple CEO for another 10 years, although there are no specific plans at this time for his retirement.  That all leads an inevitable question on investors' minds: Who will be Apple's next CEO?  Will it be Jeff Williams?  Apple's senior leadership team consists primarily of company veterans who have each been with Apple for decades. While there isn't much modern precedent to go off, it seems certain that Apple would choose an internal candidate that lives and breathes the Mac maker's culture as opposed to tapping an external leader.  Once upon a time, Scott Forstall was thought to be in line for the CEO role, but Cook fired the former software chief back in 2012 over the disastrous rollout of Apple Maps -- reportedly due to Forstall's unwillingness to take responsibility for the debacle. There has also been periodic speculation about former design chief Jony Ive becoming CEO. However, Ive left the Cupertino tech giant to start his own design firm (with Apple being its biggest client) back in 2019, and he has never been interested in becoming chief executive.  More recently, there have been indications that Apple is considering COO Jeff Williams to be the company's next CEO. A longtime lieutenant to Cook, Williams knows how to manage Apple's sprawling global operations, which is critical when considering the company's sheer scale. It's worth noting that Cook had also served as Apple COO prior to becoming CEO in 2011. Williams is widely considered to be Cook's heir apparent, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.  Nowadays, the ability to negotiate with suppliers, coordinate distribution, juggle supply chain logistics, and rally tens of thousands of employees is arguably more important to Apple's ability to execute than dreaming up the next visionary product.  That's not to say that Williams is lacking in the product department, as he currently spearheads Apple Watch development and oversees the company's digital health strategy. The COO also recently took on additional responsibilities in managing Apple's world-class design team when Ive departed and is reportedly more involved with product development than Cook currently is.  As a fitness enthusiast, Cook is in excellent health and plans to remain CEO for a few more years, according to the interview. Apple should have ample time to finalize its succession planning.\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'If there\\'s an Apple product that\\'s overdue a design refresh, it has to be the company\\'s famous all-in-one desktop computer, the iMac. With a look that\\'s been somewhat stagnant for millennia (well, since 2012), the iMac is sporting one of Apple\\'s most dated designs. But it seems that could all change this year.  Rumours have been flying for a while regarding Apple\\'s plans to launch a brand new iMac in 2021, and that it will likely feature the company\\'s groundbreaking new M1 chip. And if new leaks are to be believed, it could also feature a whopping new display size, which could put some of the best 4K monitors to shame.  The iMac could finally be in for a redesign (Image credit: Apple)  According to established Apple leaker L0vetodream, as spotted by 9to5Mac, the new 2021 iMac will feature a display that\\'s \"really big, bigger than the biggest one\". Given that the current largest iMac is 27 inches, we could be looking at a new model that\\'s at least 32 inches (this is generally the next size up for monitors).  And this fits previous rumours that Apple is planning a design reminiscent of Apple\\'s sleek (but ludicrously expensive) Pro Display XDR (below), which features tiny bezels, an ultra-slim body and a 32-inch display. Indeed, if Apple does reduce the iMac\\'s bezels, it could achieve a larger display within a similar overall profile to the current 2020 iMac.  The new design could be based on Apple\\'s Pro Display XDR (Image credit: Apple)  With Apple also said to be planning a range of brand new colours for the 2021 iMac, it seems the company is certainly planning to go all-out when it comes to giving the classic computer some much-needed design love.  And if the M1 chip does indeed make its way to the iMac, it could become the ultimate desktop for creatives. It sounds like the machines in our best computers for graphic design list had better start making a (very large) space.  Read more:'},\n",

       "  'text': \"Washington apple growers are shipping about 20 percent less fruit abroad now compared with this time last year.  The result is a drop to export levels not seen since 2003-2004, according to Washington Apple Commission president Todd Fryhover.  THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor  A boom in American consumers' online shopping during the pandemic has prompted a boost in imports from Asia. But that left U.S. agriculture products without a ride back. Many ships aren't waiting to be loaded with agricultural goods at West Coast ports before heading back across the ocean with empty containers. Plus, the Trump administration's trade war hit apples hard.  Now Eastern European countries are crunching into exports from Northwest apple growers.  Fryhover says countries like Serbia, Moldova and Russia have access to newer varieties.  “They have (been) improving horticultural practices, and their labor is much less expensive than us here in the United States,” he said.  THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor  Fryhover says his organization has seen as many as 20 different countries’ labels or cartons on apples coming into India, where the U.S. used to dominate the market. In particular, he says, many growers in Eastern European countries are concentrating on the popular Gala apples and exporting them to many countries to which the U.S. also sells.  In the bag  It turns out, pre-bagged apples are helping make up the difference. Fryhover says they’re great for retailers, and consumers tend to buy more fruit than they normally would when picking individual apples from a display bin and bagging themselves.  “So the prices are higher,” Fryhover says. “They’re selling $5 of apples rather than $0.99. And it’s very safe as far as COVID goes. … Consumers don’t have to go to pick through apples that someone else has picked through prior to them.”  Since the pandemic has curtailed other promotions like in-store samples, Fryhover says the apple industry is focusing on boosting sales with social influencers and chefs across the globe.  The numbers  Numbers are also skewed because the 2019-2020 crop was bigger than this year’s. In 2019-2020, Washington growers had 134 million 40-pound boxes of apples. And in 2020-2021, just 122 million boxes.  One reason for the smaller crop for the current season was a cold snap in October and November that left some later-season apples like Pink Ladies on the tree unpicked. And some varieties produced smaller apples as well.\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'Cupertino, California Apple today announced over 110 of its manufacturing partners around the world are moving to 100 percent renewable energy for their Apple production, with nearly 8 gigawatts of planned clean energy set to come online. Once completed, these commitments will avoid over 15 million metric tons of CO2e annually — the equivalent of taking more than 3.4 million cars off the road each year. Additionally, Apple is investing directly in renewable energy projects to cover a portion of upstream emissions, as well as a major energy storage project in California to pilot new solutions for renewable infrastructure.  “We are firmly committed to helping our suppliers become carbon neutral by 2030 and are thrilled that companies who’ve joined us span industries and countries around the world, including Germany, China, the US, India, and France,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president for Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “In a year like no other, Apple continued to work with a global network of colleagues, companies, and advocates to help make our environmental efforts and everything we do a force for good in people’s lives — and to work alongside the communities most impacted by climate change.”  Last July, the company unveiled its plan to become carbon neutral across its entire business, manufacturing supply chain, and product life cycle by 2030. Since that announcement, Apple has significantly increased the number of its suppliers that are transitioning to renewable energy. Apple is already carbon neutral today for its global corporate operations, and this new commitment means that by 2030, every Apple device sold will have net zero climate impact. The company recently shared new details about its $4.7 billion spend in Green Bonds to support environmental projects around the world.'},\n",

Everything you need to know. New York, NY, April 12, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Summer has arrived, as we all know. For some of us, this means enjoyable days at the pool, barbeques in the backyard, and exciting nights of drinking and partying with our families. However, as the temperature rises, an unwelcome intruder in the home and outdoors emerges mosquitoes. When it comes to humans, mosquitoes are the most dangerous creatures on the planet. Mosquitoes are the only organisms that can cause us so much sickness and pain! They can spread a variety of dangerous diseases that many people are unaware of: the West Nile Virus makes you feel like you\\'ve got the flu. The Zika virus causes symptoms such as fever, rash, joint pain, and pinkeye, among others. It\\'s also dangerous for pregnant women because it can cause birth defects! Encephalitis causes brain and spinal cord swelling and is extremely harmful! Mosquitoes pose a lot of needless threats to us. So, if you or someone you know suffers from Skeeter syndrome, you know how important it is for us to be vigilant about mosquito bites. Believe me when I say that you don\\'t want to contract any of the diseases that mosquitoes will spread this summer! It is for this reason that the Buzz B-Gone Zap was introduced. It is a next-generation mosquito zapper that effectively and naturally destroys mosquitos without the use of harmful chemicals. It\\'s easy to set up and can be used wherever mosquitos are a concern, and thus, it has been referred to as a \"summer saver.\" This BuzzBGone Zap review will tell you everything you need to know about this mosquito zapper, including its features, benefits, drawbacks, customer feedback, and other information. What is Buzz B Gone Zap? It is on record that mosquitoes bite people with Skeeter syndrome. The bites swell, become inflamed, and painful. Every now and then, these people get a fever. They\\'re frequently depressing, and I don\\'t think I need to tell you how heartbreaking it is to see someone you care about get sick from mosquito bites on a regular basis. The Buzz-B-Gone is an insect-killing machine that uses an electric coil to zap mosquitoes and other bugs. Mosquitos fly into the purple light and are electrocuted by the coils. It is a bug zapper that can be hanging or set upright. Simply charge the battery with the provided micro USB cable, and you\\'re ready to zap bugs and mosquitoes anywhere! This Buzz BGone Zap is merely an improvement on the original\\'s design.

Why Should You Get Rid of Mosquitoes? Mosquitoes must be eliminated as easily and efficiently as possible, in my view. When it comes to mosquitoes, most people just understand what I refer to as \"surface-level\" problems, which include: ● Humming in the ears while resting, reading, or conversing with a mate. ● Bite marks that are itchy and swollen. Most people aren\\'t aware of the \"extreme\" problems that mosquitoes can cause. The numerous diseases that can be contracted from a mosquito bite, ranging from mild to fatal, are the most serious of these concerns. These illnesses include the following: ● Malaria ● Zika Virus ● Yellow ● West Nile Virus This may appear to be a scare tactic, but it isn\\'t. I believe it is in your best interests to be aware of the potential harm that those tiny little devils can cause. There\\'s a lot more to it than just humming in your ear. If you have a mosquito problem in your home, it is imperative that you find a fast solution. Why Would You Use Buzz B-Gone Zap Mosquito Killer? There are a number of reasons to use a bug zapper like this one. To begin with, killing mosquitoes is often a good idea for a variety of reasons. Mosquitoes are harmful insects that irritate our skin, cause pain, and spread serious diseases. Since mosquito bites can be so dangerous, even the World Health Organization recommends keeping a mosquito-free zone. Apart from some general reasons, this Buzz B-Gone Zap has its own set of benefits. To begin with, it is free of the harmful chemicals used in typical sprays. It also doesn\\'t need a zapper, is fully sterile, contains no toxins, and can be kept in your bedroom to keep you healthy while you sleep. If you\\'ve ever woken up with mosquito bites, you know that the little bloodsuckers will infiltrate any house, even if you\\'re trying to escape the summer heat by refusing to open the windows. And, when you think about it, Buzz B-Gone Zap\\'s mode of operation is entirely good and effective. It emits UV light that attracts bugs, which you already know works because bug zappers have been around for a long time. A fan inside the unit draws the bugs in when they get close enough. The bugs are doomed because they can\\'t get out once they\\'re inside. After all, by keeping it plugged in for a few nights and testing the insect cell in the mornings, you can put it to the test. The number of mosquitoes trapped inside would increase. Finally, you\\'ll be able to spend the whole summer without having to deal with mosquito bites and itching on a regular basis. If you are unhappy with the device, you can return it for a full refund. The device comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee. Who Stands To Gain From Buzz B-Gone Zapper? Someone who is continuously attacked by mosquitos will benefit from this innovative insecticide. Consumers in tropical areas of the world could be more susceptible to disease-carrying flying mosquitos. On the other hand, mosquito bites and noises will affect anyone. As a result, everyone is expected to have a Buzz B-Gone Zap. This device is appropriate for people of all ages and can be used by anyone. If you\\'ve missed summer camping due to mosquitoes, are tired of missing dinner parties due to mosquito bites, or can\\'t just have a nice family dinner in your backyard due to mosquitoes, this strong Buzz B-Gone Mosquito Trap Zapper gadget is for you. However, this device is not ideal for large buildings such as churches, restaurants, or other places where the capacity is exceeded. In such situations, the bulky bug zapper will be needed. Bug zappers, on the other hand, are often expensive. Small spaces, such as bedrooms or backyards, are ideal for Buzz B-Gone. BuzzBGone will give you peace of mind if your home is a bug/mosquito retreat center. Your surroundings are a huge source of bugs. Bugs are often a major problem for campers and hikers who want to enjoy the outdoors. Allergies are a hassle to handle. There will be no more untimely sneezes, coughs, or itchy bare skin with a Buzz B-Gone mosquito-killing kit. It\\'s also a money saver. It\\'s a home-based gadget that may not function in a larger environment, particularly if there\\'s a lot of foot traffic. If you are visiting a mosquito-infested place, bring your device with you to ensure a comfortable stay. What\\'s the Best Way to Use the BuzzBGone Zap? This device is incredibly simple to operate. It is ready to use right out of the box to kill mosquitos. Simply charge the device and position it in an environment where there are a lot of airborne bugs/mosquitoes. The device would then go to work, trapping mosquitos within the reservoir and killing them. ● Step 1: Use the provided micro USB cable to charge the Buzz B-Gone Zap. The LED indicator turns red when the battery is charging and orange when it is fully charged. ● Step 2: Turn the top rotary switch to turn on the device. After you hear a \"click,\" the purple LEDs will turn on. ● Step 3: For best results, place the Buzz B-Gone Zap in the desired location and leave it running for at least 2 hours. Mosquitoes and other flying insects would not be able to infest the region as a result of this. It is advisable that cleaning this device should be done on a regular basis. How Does The Buzz B Gone Zap Work? BuzzBGone Zap uses purple LEDs to lure mosquitoes and other bugs, then kills them with an electric coil. To attract and capture bugs, BuzzBGone uses a UV light and a suction fan. Mosquitos and other flying insects are naturally drawn to UV light, but the device\\'s powerful fan sucks them in, killing them. The combination of these two technical components aids in the development of this efficient buzzing insect killer. Yes, absolutely! Hundreds of mosquitos are drawn to the UV light, and the suction fan is both quiet and powerful. BuzzBGone\\'s proprietary design can destroy a persistent flood of mosquitoes due to the combination of these two technological features. With the use of this product, the user\\'s flying insect problem should be resolved easily. Buzz B-Gone is a cylindrical flying bug trap, control, and kill device that emits a 360° UV light, as previously mentioned. This light draws insects from the surrounding area, similar to bug zappers. In research, UV light has been shown to attract flying insects like mosquitoes, flies, gnats, and more. However, it does not zap the bugs as they approach. Instead, a powerful 360-degree fan pulls them in and transports them to the holding room, a trap from which they cannot run. Any bug that comes close to the light, which attracts nearly every irritating bug, becomes trapped within the BuzzBGone device. Mosquitoes, like humans, are water-dependent. In contrast, Buzz B-Gone is completely devoid of water. Instead, it has a dehydrator, which speeds up the dehydration process and allows the bugs it catches to die quickly. Simply plug the system into any available outlet to use it. The Buzz B Gone is then amazingly easy to activate and use. This is all that is needed to develop its capabilities and eradicate bugs permanently. Where Would You Buy BuzzBGone Zap? Simply go to the manufacturer\\'s website and place your order.

On the official website, the device has a lot of positive feedback, but there aren\\'t many reviews elsewhere. Most buyers believed that it works as advertised to kill mosquitos with minimal effort. Customers have posted the following BuzzBGone Zapper testimonials online: (Gary E- Omaha, NE .) \"I was sceptical at first that this device would work, but I must say I\\'m very pleased with it.\" It charges quickly and stays charged during the evening. My wife and I can now enjoy our drinks in the backyard without being chased into the house by mosquitoes! We\\'re getting a lot more out of our summer now.\" (Mark P. Los Angeles, CA.) \"As soon as I read the testimonials, I realized Buzz B-Gone was the real deal. It utilizes the same equipment as the thousands-of-dollar commercial bug zappers used on restaurant patios. I built one in each of our bedrooms because we sleep with the windows open. If we\\'re getting a barbeque, I even take one outside. It repels ALL mosquitos and attracts flies and other bothersome insects as well!\" (Louise D. Portland, OR) \"My dogs like evenings on the deck, but the bugs feast on them, and they dislike it!\" I took my Buzz B-Gone Zap with me, and it worked well. There will be no more mosquitoes, and the puppies will be able to relax in peace.\" (Brooke King – Detroit, MI) \"I\\'m reclaiming my season.\" I understand that mosquito bites are unpleasant. Yet, they were much worse for me. The bites cause an allergic reaction, and the itching and swelling are intolerable.

Users have openly asked online about the Buzz B-Gone scam, and it appears that there is little doubt or reservation about the effectiveness of this common insect zapper.

       "  'text': 'The lawsuit between Epic and Apple over the latter\\'s control of the iOS App Store is sure to reveal plenty of interesting pieces of information about how the two companies operate. As a reminder, Epic is suing Apple because the iPhone-maker kicked Fortnite (which is made by Epic) out of the App Store when the game added its own in-app purchase feature last summer.  Epic alleges that Apple is engaging in anti-competitive practices because it has a monopoly over the market for app distribution on iPhones. Apple\\'s position is that Epic violated the guidelines it agreed to and that Fortnite can return if it simply rolls back the change.  All of that is interesting, but even more revealing is how Apple decided long ago to never bring iMessage to Android. According to a filing from Epic, \"As early as 2013, Apple decided not to develop a version of iMessage for the Android OS.\"  That\\'s based on a deposition with Eddie Cue, Apple\\'s SVP of internet software and services. According to the documents, the only reason Apple didn\\'t make such a version is that \"iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove an obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android Phones.\"  Interestingly, Apple\\'s Messages app is only really a big deal in the U.S. As Tom Warren, an editor for The Verge points out, in most other countries, people use alternatives like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, WeChat, or Telegram:  Still, iMessages is representative of one of the things that makes Apple\\'s ecosystem so powerful and profitable--everything just works together. The more Apple products and services you use, the harder it is to leave.  \"The more people use our stores the more likely they are to buy additional Apple products and upgrade to the latest versions,\" Cue is quoted as saying. \"Who\\'s going to buy a Samsung phone if they have apps, movies, etc already purchased? They now need to spend hundreds more to get to where they are today.\"  If a customer were to buy a non-Apple phone, they would have to \"buy some of these things again.\" In that sense, there\\'s really no motivation for Apple to open up its ecosystem.  You can debate whether or not Apple should open its ecosystem, and there are various arguments for both sides. Would it be better for users if they could more easily switch between platforms? Of course, it would. Then again, the fact that Apple does control the entire ecosystem--from hardware to software--means it generally provides a better overall experience compared with its competition.  iMessage is a great example. When iPhone users send a message to another iPhone user, the messages appear in blue bubbles. When the message is from a non-iPhone user, the bubble is green. There are plenty of stories of how iPhone users turn up their nose at their green-bubble friends.  iPhone user\\'s distaste for those green bubbles isn\\'t just about being tech-snobs, by the way. There are plenty of features that simply don\\'t work when sending messages to non-iPhone users, especially in group chats.  There was no technical reason Apple couldn\\'t have made iMessage work on Android, it was simply a business decision. Phil Schiller, who was previously the head of worldwide marketing for Apple for decades, and who is now an Apple Fellow but retains leadership of the App Store, said: \"moving iMessage to Android will hurt us more than help us.\"'},\n",

       "  'text': 'The widely expected March Apple event now appears to be destined to take place in April, in spite of the plethora of rumors claiming that there would be an Apple event on Tuesday, March 23, to announce new iPads, AirPods, and the long-awaited AirTags.    Mixed-bag leaker Jon Prosser first claimed that an Apple Event was planned for March 16, but that was subsequently ruled out by reliable Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman. Once that date passed, Prosser and a number of other leakers then suggested there would be an Apple Event on March 23.  The speculation seemed to be in line with previous years, given that Apple has unveiled new hardware every March since 2014. With no March 23 \\u200cApple event\\u200c and the chances of an event falling before the end of the month looking to be very slim, rumors are now congregating around April for new Apple product announcements.  The first indication that Apple might have new hardware planned for April came from Japanese website Mac Otakara in early January. Citing supply chain sources, the blog claimed that Apple would release second-generation AirPods Pro and a third-generation iPhone SE in April, but the report did not specify whether the products would be announced at an event or with press releases. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has since claimed that a new iPhone SE will not be released until 2022, but updated AirPods Pro are still a possibility this spring.  Talk of an April event has now intensified, starting with a report from Taiwanese supply chain publication DigiTimes that claimed volume shipments of Mini-LED display components for a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro will begin in the second quarter of 2021, which spans April through June. This was followed by a report from Gurman, who claimed that plans to announce new iPads as early as April, including new 11-inch and 12.9-inch \\u200ciPad Pro\\u200c models.  Kuo added to the April rumors last week, claiming that mass production of mini-LED iPads will begin in mid-to-late April.  According to Prosser, Apple plans to host an event in April this year. In a YouTube video, Prosser explained that he was actually told by a \"vague and mysterious\" source who has been \"100 percent accurate\" that there would be an April event in late February, but Prosser thought that an April event made \"little to no sense\" and he was more inclined to believe his sources making claims about a March 23 event.  Prosser acknowledges that it is worth treating this April event rumor with some skepticism since it would be Apple\\'s first April event in 11 years, but he also emphasized his source\\'s perfect track record. It is also worth noting that Prosser has been incorrect about three consecutive event date rumors, including a November 17 event, a March 16 event, and a March 23 event.  Although Apple announced a number of products between September and December last year, including the Apple Watch Series 6 and Apple Watch SE, iPad Air 4, iPhone 12 lineup, three Macs with Apple silicon chips, and AirPods Max, there are still several new Apple products expected to launch soon.  Apple\\'s last April event was in 2010, when the late Steve Jobs announced the developer preview of iPhone OS 4 (later renamed iOS 4). 11 years later, 2021\\'s rumored April event could see the announcement of new iPad Pro models and the debut of AirTags item trackers, plus we could also see new iPad mini and low-cost iPad models.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Apple has been working on new ways to let users know more about the battery life of their devices, and it seems that the company plans to add even more related features to iOS. The US Patent & Trademark Office this week granted Apple a patent for a new system that can predict and warn the user when the iPhone battery is expected to run out.  As noted by Apple Insider, the patent is described as a “smart advice to charge notification.” Instead of helping to preserve internal battery life as some iOS features already do, this new system would help users know how long the battery will last during the day based on their recent usage.  On current devices, the user only gets a warning about low battery when it reaches 20%, but the patent shows a way to make these notifications more smart and personal. While this works well in most scenarios, Apple gives an example where the user forgets to recharge the phone overnight and only gets the low battery alert before leaving for work.  Often, a “battery low” indication that is based on a fixed threshold of charge remaining is not received in time for the user to take a corrective action. For example, if a user typically charges her smart phone at night, but forgets to do so on one occasion, receiving a “battery low” indication just before leaving for work the next day does not leave the user time to charge her phone before work.  If you’re a Mac user, you’ve probably noticed that macOS shows the estimated battery life to users — but this patent describes a more complex system than that. For instance, it would identify the user’s behavior on different days of the week to adjust the battery alerts for each day. The system would also work based on the user’s location, but Apple reinforces that the data would be processed locally due to privacy concerns.  Given a current state of charge of an energy storage device computing system, a notification can be sent to the user if there is a high probability that the user is unlikely to make it until the next high probability charge time. […] However, if analysis of the current, and stored, state of charge information indicates that the user will not make it to their next high probability charge time without running out of energy, the computing device can display an advice to charge notification at 10 p.m., even though the current state of charge is greater than the fixed threshold of 10% remaining energy.  While not necessarily patents filed by Apple are actually used, the company recently added a new battery recalibration tool for iPhone 11 users with the iOS 14.5 beta. In addition, iOS also shows the maximum capacity of the device’s internal battery, so it won’t be a surprise if Apple introduces a feature like this described in the patent with iOS 15.

       "  'text': 'If you don’t track Apple rumors as meticulously as we do here at Macworld, you might be a little confused this week. While we were all planning to watch an Apple event next week, that all came crashing down when a flurry of new rumors (that contradicted the old rumors) left us all scratching our heads. If you’re confused, let us break it all down for you.  Will there be a spring event?  It was previously rumored that Apple would be holding an event in late March, with March 23 pinpointed by people who were supposedly in the know. That no longer seems to be the case. For one, Apple hasn’t sent out invitations for a March event yet, which it most likely would have done by now, even for a virtual event. Plus, Jon Prosser, who had previously sworn by the March 23 date, backtracked yesterday and said the event will actually be held in April.  We don’t actually have any indication that Apple will be holding a spring event at all, so we wouldn’t necessarily bet on an April event either. Prosser is the only leaker so far to promise an April event, so until we get some confirmation from Mark Gurman or some other reliable source of rumors, we’re going to remain skeptical.  What is releasing this spring?  Originally, we thought Apple’s spring event would bring three new products: the fifth-gen iPad Pro, third-gen AirPods, and the launch of Apple’s long-rumored AirTags. But now we’re not so sure. Here’s what’s we expect from a spring event or product launch.  Fifth-gen iPad Pro  Apple/IDG  The iPad Pro is seemingly still on track for a spring launch. Apple’s flagship tablet is all but certain to gain 5G networking and an A14 chip like the iPhone 13, which would position it firmly at the top of the tablet food chain. A report in Bloomberg also claims the iPad Pro might be getting a Thunderbolt connector, an upgrade over the current USB-C port. While the connector is the same, the new port would bring faster data transfers and higher-resolution display support.  Bloomberg also says the larger 12.9-inch model might also be getting a mini LED display “which would be brighter and have improved contrast ratios.” We’ve heard rumors of a mini-LED iPad for a while, with Ming-Chi Kuo previously reporting that production would begin in April.  IDG  AirTags have been rumored for years, and there hasn’t been a recent Apple event that didn’t include a rumor about its release. Speculation is that they would be circular Bluetooth trackers that can attach to non-Apple devices like backpacks and keys. Similar to Tile trackers, AirTags will presumably have a leg up on its competitors by tapping into the U1 ultra wideband chip in the iPhone 11 and 12, Apple Watch Series 6 to enable precise location tracking. AirTags will also reportedly tap into the larger iPhone network to help find lost items that are out of Bluetooth range. When someone using an iPhone passes by your lost keys, for example, it would send anonymous location data to your phone so you can track them down in the Find My app.  What about AirPods?  Roman Loyola/IDG  Despite a torrent of leaks including purported product images, a rumor earlier this week by oft-accurate Ming-Chi Kuo said AirPods production had been pushed back to the third quarter of 2021, likely signifying a fall launch alongside the iPhone 13. When they do release, the new AirPods are expected to have shorter stems like the AirPods Pro, but reportedly won’t bring high-end features like noise-cancelation.  The rumor mill calls these “AirPods 3,” but there was never actually an “AirPods 2.” There was a modest update to the original AirPods, which were still just called AirPods. It’s unclear whether these new models will get an updated name or not.  What’s coming later in the year?  Beyond April, rumors are very sketchy, but here’s what we expect in 2021:  iPhone 13 or 12s: We don’t know what it will be called, but you can bet any amount of money on a new iPhone lunching in the fall. They’re likely to keep the same design but could have a smaller notch and in-display Touch ID.  Apple Watch Series 7: Like the iPhone, Apple launches a new watch each year like clockwork. We haven’t heard any details about a possible new model, however.  iPad and iPad mini: Bloomberg reports that Apple is working on a 9th-gen iPad with a thinner and lighter design, as well as a new iPad mini with a larger screen. Apple hasn’t changed the mini’s 7.9-inch screen since it launched in 2012.  MacBook Pro: The Apple silicon transition is expected to ramp up this year, with rumored 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models on the way. They could bring some big changes to the line, including an HDMI port, SD card reader, and MagSafe charging, as well as the possible removal of the TouchBar. Additionally, they may get mini-LED displays that are brighter and thinner. New models are likely to arrive in the second half of the year.  iMac: The iMac is also rumored to get a major Apple silicon-based redesign that trims the bezels, removes the chin, and adds more ports. They could arrive as early as WWDC in June or July.'},\n",

       "  'text': \"Apple has adjusted the trade-in values of a number of its products, including the majority of the iPad and Mac lineup, while also making some changes to iPhone.    Apple's trade-in program allows customers to trade-in older devices, and receive a certain amount of value for them, to use towards a purchase of a new device. The exact trade-in value a device has is measured by its condition, when it was released, and its manufacturer. Apple last notably updated its trade-in prices in December, and furthermore, it has made some more changes over the weekend.  It's important to note that the value shown on Apple's website reflects the maximum possible trade-in value for a product.  On the \\u200ciPad\\u200c lineup, the iPad Pro has had its value go up by $45 to $580, versus the previous $535. The standard \\u200ciPad\\u200c trade-in value has gone down by $15 to $235. In the Mac family, the MacBook Air is now valued at $530, down from $600. The discontinued MacBook is down by $40 to $340, and the discontinued iMac Pro is valued at $2,940, down $100. iMac value has had a reduction by $130 to $1,050, and the Mac mini down $60, to a value of $770.  With the \\u200ciPhone\\u200c, Apple has also made some changes. The maximum trade-in value of the iPhone 11 Pro Max is up by $15 to $515, the iPhone 11 Pro up by $5 to $465, and the \\u200ciPhone 11\\u200c up by $20 to a maximum value of $380. The \\u200ciPhone\\u200c 6S Plus value has gone up to $65, versus $60.  Recently Apple also expanded the list of Android devices eligible for trade-in, adding the Google Pixel 4a, Pixel 5, and Samsung Galaxy Note 20.

       "  'text': 'Apple on Tuesday announced that WWDC 2021 is set to take place the week of June 7, and the entirely-online affair should be a good one, especially for the Mac. Apple’s PC already had a big year in 2020 with the release of the M1 system on a chip and macOS Big Sur, and WWDC should keep the momentum going with a massive event focused on the Mac. Here’s everything we expect to see when the keynote kicks off.  New Macs  We’ll dive into what we expect from Apple’s chips below, but we think WWDC 21 is going to deliver some serious hardware. Now that the Mac mini, entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro, and MacBook Air have been outfitted with M1 chips, it’s time to see what changes are in store for the higher-end of Apple’s Mac lineup.  Mac Pro: Since this is a developers’ conference, it makes sense to highlight Apple’s most powerful Mac. But Apple also said that its silicon rollout will be a two-year process, and we’re only in year one. So with the Mac Pro rollout, Apple could reveal a couple of models on the low-end, with the pricier, more powerful Mac Pros still using Intel processors. Apple could also show some major tower modifications thanks to the M21X’s ability to run cooler than its Intel counterparts. Like the previous Mac Pro introductions, however, we don’t expect these models to ship until later in the year.  The iMac hasn’t seen a major resigned in a very long time. A Pro Display-like design would be impressive. Apple  iMac: The iMac Pro and several configurations of the iMac were recently discontinued, but the signs say that an Apple silicon iMac will be announced at WWDC21, and will probably ship soon afterward. Rumors say that the new iMac will be available in 24- and 27-inch models, and the new design will resemble Apple’s Pro Display. Apple will probably keep the $1,099 Intel-based 21.5-inch iMac as an affordable option. New iMacs will likely be available to order immediately.  MacBook Pro: Apple released a pair of 13-inch M1 models last year, and those will stay as affordable options. The higher-end 13-inch models that Apple usually offers could see a change, however—most likely, they’ll get a treatment similar to what the 15-inch MacBook Pro got to become the 16-inch MacBook Pro, creating a new 14-inch MacBook Pro. The 16-inch MacBook Pro hasn’t been upgraded since its release in 2019, so that will definitely get the Apple silicon treatment. These laptops could be available for order at WWDC21.  M1 CPU  Not long after Apple released the M1-based MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and Mac mini, speculation of the next SoC for Apple’s high-end Macs went into high gear, with several reports stating that it would appear in the second half of this year. So it seems to be that a WWDC21 unveiling would be perfect timing.  Apple next SoC is certain to have more data processing oomph, so it could have even more processing cores that the 8-cores in the M1—think 16- and 32-cores. We could also see a boost from the M1’s 16 cores for the Neural Engine. As far as the SoC’s name, I don’t think Apple will label this SoC the “M2” just yet so expect it to be called the “M1X” or something similar to keep it part of Apple’s first-generation silicon. (Rumor has it that the next SoC in line has the code-name of “Jade.”)  Then there’s the memory. The current baseline with the M1 is 8GB and the maximum is 16GB, which is integrated into the SoC, so you can’t add more at a later time. Even though Apple silicon Macs use memory differently from Intel-based Macs, the amount of memory is a concern for more demanding users. Users of pro apps run the risk of running out of physical memory, and when that happens, the Mac then resorts to using the SSD to compensate. And when that happens, there’s a performance hit—and that leads to the concern that the SSD will wear out faster than it should.  Because users of high-end Macs are more demanding on memory, expect Apple to outfit the MacBook Pros and the iMacs with a baseline of 16GB and a maximum of 32GB. If we get a look at the high-end desktop Mac Pro, it will probably still have user-accessible DIMM slots so you can add a terabyte or more of memory as needed.  M1 GPU  The M1 SoC has an 8-core graphics processor (7-cores in the $999 MacBook Air), and it does a really good job handling graphics for consumers. But it may not be enough for pro users, and a report out of China stated that Apple is developing a more powerful GPU for the iMac.  Apple’s M1 features an 8-core GPU. That may not be enough for a high-end Mac user. Apple  Anything about the GPU configuration is pure speculation at this point, but here’s our guess as to what you’ll see: an M1X GPU that offers more cores than the M1, supplemented by AMD GPUs to handle more heavy-duty graphics work. The 16-inch MacBook Pro and higher-end iMac models have discreet Radeon GPU upgrades from AMD, so we could see some serious graphics card power from the M1X, especially if we get a look at the new Mac Pro. Mac Pro users have extremely high-end GPU demands, so we don’t quite know what that would look like in an Apple-design GPU. But we can’t wait to see it.  macOS 12  On the same day that WWDC21 was announced, some sleuths poking around WebKit noticed a reference to macOS 12. Apple uses WWDC to showcase its operating system updates, and a change in version number may have you thinking that major changes in the OS are in store. That could be true, but more likely this is simply a change in Apple’s nomenclature so it’s more like that of iOS and iPadOS, which get whole number name changes every year.  The switch from macOS Catalina 10.x to macOS Big Sur 11.x was as big of a change as macOS has had recently, so that could mean that macOS 12 is more of a maintenance release that fixes and refines a lot of things, complimented with a dozen or so new features. Here are some of the features we’re hoping to see.  Shortcuts for macOS. Make it happen, Apple. Apple  Shortcuts for Mac: The iPhone’s Siri-based automation app would be very much welcomed on macOS. AppleScript and Automator are still available, but they’re older tools.  Siri improvements: There’s always room for improvement with Siri, which still isn’t on par with Google and Amazon’s offerings. Apple makes Siri development a priority with iPhones and iPads, but we’d like to see Siri get some love on the Mac, too.  Improved support for iPhone and iPad apps: Apple introduced this feature with Big Sur, and Apple continues to tweak it in with each update. There’s still work to be done, however.  More Control Center shortcuts: Big Sur’s Control Center—which mirrors the same features in iOS/iPadOS—helps clean up the cluttered menu bar in an intuitive way. But it has very limited options as to what shortcuts it can display. For starters, we’d like to see as many options on the Mac as there are on the iPhone.  Wallet: The Wallet app makes perfect sense on an iPhone, since you’re usually carrying it while you shop. But for those of us who do almost all of our online shopping on a Mac, it would be nice if there was one central location to organize payment accounts that was more robust than the System Preferences pane. Not to mention, a place to pay your Apple Card.  Desktop widgets: macOS Big Sur brought the same customizable widgets to the Mac that iOS 14 brought to the iPhone, and we’re loving them. But we’d love a way to bring them out of the Notification Center like we could with Dashboard widgets.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Tim Cook might only be 60, but he’s already thinking about his time after Apple. In an interview with Kara Swisher on her “Sway” podcast, Cook weighed in on Facebook, the possibility of an Apple car, App Store rules, and his future with Apple.  Let’s start with that last one. One of Swisher’s last questions to Cook was a seemingly innocuous one that he answered with surprising candidness. When posed with the question, “Are you going to be at Apple 10 more years?” Cook has this to say:  “Ten more years, probably not. But I can tell you that I feel great right now. And the date’s not in sight. But ten more years is a long time and probably not ten more years.”  Cook said he doesn’t “have a clue” what he would do if he left Apple because “I love this company so much,” but it’s clear that he’s thinking of a time when he isn’t running the largest company in the world. It’s not immediately clear who Cook’s successor would be, but Jeff Williams is currently chief operating officer, the position Cook held before Steve Jobs named Cook as his successor.  Cook also talked a lot about privacy and the App Store, specifically about app curation. He expressed regret over the Parler standoff and said he hopes they come back. “We care deeply about what we’re offering our users. And when we have a news product like Apple News, we have human editors that are selecting the key stories. And so, they’re avoiding all of the misinformation that is out there. The reality is that the web in some areas has become a dark place. And without curation, you wind up with this firehose of things that I would not want to put into an amplifier.”  Cook reiterated that privacy is “a basic human right,” and admitted that “regulation is required” to fix the current “crisis.” He talked at length about the App Tracking Transparency feature in IOS 14.5 and said the release, which has been in beta development since February, is due in “just a few weeks.” He said he was “shocked” at the pushback from Facebook and others and believes “that you can do digital advertising and make money from digital advertising without tracking people when they don’t know they’re being tracked.”  AR and cars  As he has in the past, Cook once again praised the potential of augmented reality and artificial intelligence. While he obviously refused to “talk about anything that may or may not be in the pipeline, Cook offered an example for how AR could enhance the interview: “You and I are having a great conversation right now. Arguably, it could even be better if we were able to augment our discussion with charts or other things to appear. And your audience would also benefit from this, too.”  That offers a glimpse into how Apple sees its rumored glasses fitting into everyday life. Cook rattled off several industries that are already benefitting from AR—health, education, gaming, retail—and added that “the promise is even greater in the future.”  Finally, Swisher brought up the subject of the Apple car, Apple longest-rumored project. Cook was coy and vague, but praised Elon Musk and Tesla, saying he’s “done an unbelievable job of not only establishing the lead, but keeping the lead for such a long period of time in the (electric vehicle) space.”  However, he wouldn’t bite when Swisher pushed him on the Apple car, first saying that Apple “investigate(s) so many things internally. Many of them never see the light of day. I’m not saying that one will not.” When pressed again, he flat out refused to answer: “Yeah, I’m not going to answer that question.”  However, he didn’t discount the idea outright: “We love to integrate hardware, software, and services, and find the intersection points of those because we think that’s where the magic occurs. And so that’s what we love to do. And we love to own the primary technology that’s around that.”You can listen to the podcast and read the entire transcript of the interview here.'},\n",

BuzzBGone Zap Review: Is this Buzz B Gone Zapper worth my money? By Apex Reviews Buzz B Gone Zap Reviews - Feature and Specifications, Pros and Cons, Customer Reviews and Pricing. Everything you need to know. New York, NY, April 12, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Summer has arrived, as we all know. For some of us, this means enjoyable days at the pool, barbeques in the backyard, and exciting nights of drinking and partying with our families. However, as the temperature rises, an unwelcome intruder in the home and outdoors emerges mosquitoes. When it comes to humans, mosquitoes are the most dangerous creatures on the planet. Mosquitoes are the only organisms that can cause us so much sickness and pain! They can spread a variety of dangerous diseases that many people are unaware of: the West Nile Virus makes you feel like you\\'ve got the flu. The Zika virus causes symptoms such as fever, rash, joint pain, and pinkeye, among others. It\\'s also dangerous for pregnant women because it can cause birth defects! Encephalitis causes brain and spinal cord swelling and is extremely harmful! Mosquitoes pose a lot of needless threats to us. So, if you or someone you know suffers from Skeeter syndrome, you know how important it is for us to be vigilant about mosquito bites. Believe me when I say that you don\\'t want to contract any of the diseases that mosquitoes will spread this summer! It is for this reason that the Buzz B-Gone Zap was introduced. It is a next-generation mosquito zapper that effectively and naturally destroys mosquitos without the use of harmful chemicals. It\\'s easy to set up and can be used wherever mosquitos are a concern, and thus, it has been referred to as a \"summer saver.\" This BuzzBGone Zap review will tell you everything you need to know about this mosquito zapper, including its features, benefits, drawbacks, customer feedback, and other information. What is Buzz B Gone Zap? It is on record that mosquitoes bite people with Skeeter syndrome. The bites swell, become inflamed, and painful. Every now and then, these people get a fever. They\\'re frequently depressing, and I don\\'t think I need to tell you how heartbreaking it is to see someone you care about get sick from mosquito bites on a regular basis. The Buzz-B-Gone is an insect-killing machine that uses an electric coil to zap mosquitoes and other bugs. Mosquitos fly into the purple light and are electrocuted by the coils. It is a bug zapper that can be hanging or set upright. Simply charge the battery with the provided micro USB cable, and you\\'re ready to zap bugs and mosquitoes anywhere! This Buzz BGone Zap is merely an improvement on the original\\'s design. The previous design was such a success that the company wanted to develop it for even greater efficiency and customer satisfaction, and that\\'s why they developed this recent mind-blowing Buzz B Gone Insect Zapper. All you have to do is plug it in to kill hundreds of mosquitoes. This bug zapper is ideal for use when hiking, at the park, or simply relaxing on your deck on a warm summer evening. There\\'s no need to set it up, program something, spray away, pushbuttons, or something like that. It\\'s as simple as getting it out of the box and plugging it in. The Buzz B-Gone Mosquito Zapper has a 360-degree field UV light that will attract and trap biting mosquitoes, safely dehydrating and killing them one by one as they get entangled in the suction fan\\'s whirling power.

Why Should You Get Rid of Mosquitoes? Mosquitoes must be eliminated as easily and efficiently as possible, in my view. When it comes to mosquitoes, most people just understand what I refer to as \"surface-level\" problems, which include: ● Humming in the ears while resting, reading, or conversing with a mate. ● Bite marks that are itchy and swollen. Most people aren\\'t aware of the \"extreme\" problems that mosquitoes can cause. The numerous diseases that can be contracted from a mosquito bite, ranging from mild to fatal, are the most serious of these concerns. These illnesses include the following: ● Malaria ● Zika Virus ● Yellow ● West Nile Virus This may appear to be a scare tactic, but it isn\\'t. I believe it is in your best interests to be aware of the potential harm that those tiny little devils can cause. There\\'s a lot more to it than just humming in your ear. If you have a mosquito problem in your home, it is imperative that you find a fast solution. Why Would You Use Buzz B-Gone Zap Mosquito Killer? There are a number of reasons to use a bug zapper like this one. To begin with, killing mosquitoes is often a good idea for a variety of reasons. Mosquitoes are harmful insects that irritate our skin, cause pain, and spread serious diseases. Since mosquito bites can be so dangerous, even the World Health Organization recommends keeping a mosquito-free zone. Apart from some general reasons, this Buzz B-Gone Zap has its own set of benefits. To begin with, it is free of the harmful chemicals used in typical sprays. It also doesn\\'t need a zapper, is fully sterile, contains no toxins, and can be kept in your bedroom to keep you healthy while you sleep. If you\\'ve ever woken up with mosquito bites, you know that the little bloodsuckers will infiltrate any house, even if you\\'re trying to escape the summer heat by refusing to open the windows. And, when you think about it, Buzz B-Gone Zap\\'s mode of operation is entirely good and effective. It emits UV light that attracts bugs, which you already know works because bug zappers have been around for a long time. A fan inside the unit draws the bugs in when they get close enough. The bugs are doomed because they can\\'t get out once they\\'re inside. After all, by keeping it plugged in for a few nights and testing the insect cell in the mornings, you can put it to the test. The number of mosquitoes trapped inside would increase. Finally, you\\'ll be able to spend the whole summer without having to deal with mosquito bites and itching on a regular basis. If you are unhappy with the device, you can return it for a full refund. The device comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee. Who Stands To Gain From Buzz B-Gone Zapper? Someone who is continuously attacked by mosquitos will benefit from this innovative insecticide. Consumers in tropical areas of the world could be more susceptible to disease-carrying flying mosquitos. On the other hand, mosquito bites and noises will affect anyone. As a result, everyone is expected to have a Buzz B-Gone Zap. This device is appropriate for people of all ages and can be used by anyone. If you\\'ve missed summer camping due to mosquitoes, are tired of missing dinner parties due to mosquito bites, or can\\'t just have a nice family dinner in your backyard due to mosquitoes, this strong Buzz B-Gone Mosquito Trap Zapper gadget is for you. However, this device is not ideal for large buildings such as churches, restaurants, or other places where the capacity is exceeded. In such situations, the bulky bug zapper will be needed. Bug zappers, on the other hand, are often expensive. Small spaces, such as bedrooms or backyards, are ideal for Buzz B-Gone. BuzzBGone will give you peace of mind if your home is a bug/mosquito retreat center. Your surroundings are a huge source of bugs. Bugs are often a major problem for campers and hikers who want to enjoy the outdoors. Allergies are a hassle to handle. There will be no more untimely sneezes, coughs, or itchy bare skin with a Buzz B-Gone mosquito-killing kit. It\\'s also a money saver. It\\'s a home-based gadget that may not function in a larger environment, particularly if there\\'s a lot of foot traffic. If you are visiting a mosquito-infested place, bring your device with you to ensure a comfortable stay. What\\'s the Best Way to Use the BuzzBGone Zap? This device is incredibly simple to operate. It is ready to use right out of the box to kill mosquitos. Simply charge the device and position it in an environment where there are a lot of airborne bugs/mosquitoes. The device would then go to work, trapping mosquitos within the reservoir and killing them. ● Step 1: Use the provided micro USB cable to charge the Buzz B-Gone Zap. The LED indicator turns red when the battery is charging and orange when it is fully charged. ● Step 2: Turn the top rotary switch to turn on the device. After you hear a \"click,\" the purple LEDs will turn on. ● Step 3: For best results, place the Buzz B-Gone Zap in the desired location and leave it running for at least 2 hours. Mosquitoes and other flying insects would not be able to infest the region as a result of this. It is advisable that cleaning this device should be done on a regular basis. How Does The Buzz B Gone Zap Work? BuzzBGone Zap uses purple LEDs to lure mosquitoes and other bugs, then kills them with an electric coil. To attract and capture bugs, BuzzBGone uses a UV light and a suction fan. Mosquitos and other flying insects are naturally drawn to UV light, but the device\\'s powerful fan sucks them in, killing them. The combination of these two technical components aids in the development of this efficient buzzing insect killer. Yes, absolutely! Hundreds of mosquitos are drawn to the UV light, and the suction fan is both quiet and powerful. BuzzBGone\\'s proprietary design can destroy a persistent flood of mosquitoes due to the combination of these two technological features. With the use of this product, the user\\'s flying insect problem should be resolved easily. Buzz B-Gone is a cylindrical flying bug trap, control, and kill device that emits a 360° UV light, as previously mentioned. This light draws insects from the surrounding area, similar to bug zappers. In research, UV light has been shown to attract flying insects like mosquitoes, flies, gnats, and more. However, it does not zap the bugs as they approach. Instead, a powerful 360-degree fan pulls them in and transports them to the holding room, a trap from which they cannot run. Any bug that comes close to the light, which attracts nearly every irritating bug, becomes trapped within the BuzzBGone device. Mosquitoes, like humans, are water-dependent. In contrast, Buzz B-Gone is completely devoid of water. Instead, it has a dehydrator, which speeds up the dehydration process and allows the bugs it catches to die quickly. Simply plug the system into any available outlet to use it. The Buzz B Gone is then amazingly easy to activate and use. This is all that is needed to develop its capabilities and eradicate bugs permanently. Where Would You Buy BuzzBGone Zap? Simply go to the manufacturer\\'s website and place your order.

Portland, OR) \"My dogs like evenings on the deck, but the bugs feast on them, and they dislike it!\" I took my Buzz B-Gone Zap with me, and it worked well. There will be no more mosquitoes, and the puppies will be able to relax in peace.\" (Brooke King – Detroit, MI) \"I\\'m reclaiming my season.\" I understand that mosquito bites are unpleasant.

It allows me to enjoy the evening outside rather than being cooped up inside like a prisoner.\" (Alan H. - Baltimore, MD) \"Last spring was extremely wet, with plenty of sunshine. Mosquitoes were in full effect, making time on the patio even less fun.

Co-founders Arfa Rehman and Scott Gorman saw the need for guidance and support during menopause, and together they launched Caria (formerly called Clio) — a personalized guide to help users understand menopausal changes and manage their symptoms.  “There is a lack of education about menopause and its treatments in the medical community, as only 20 percent of ob-gyn residency programs in the US have a formal menopause curriculum,” says Rehman, who is also CEO of Caria. “As a result, many medical professionals don’t have the training to diagnose and treat menopausal symptoms, often leaving women with insufficient options and support.”  In a survey conducted by the Female Founders Fund, 78 percent of respondents indicated that menopause interferes with their lives, and 23 percent of respondents indicated that menopause had either “a great deal” or “completely debilitating” impact on their lives.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Apple cider vinegar is a highly acidic, fermented liquid made from apple juice. It’s a popular cooking ingredient and dietary supplement. While some people take it straight, others add it to their water, take apple cider vinegar supplements, or drink beverages that contain apple cider vinegar. Some evidence suggests that the vinegar may help lower blood sugar levels and boost weight loss, both of which are often the goals of many people who fast. Fasting helps you enter ketosis, a metabolic state in which your body burns stored body fat rather than energy derived from food as its primary fuel source ( 1 ). However, you may wonder whether you can safely take apple cider vinegar while fasting without being kicked out of ketosis. This article reviews how apple cider vinegar affects fasting and how much you should take. Share on Pinterest Photography by Aya Brackett  How apple cider vinegar affects a fast To stay in ketosis in a fasted state, you have to maintain an extremely low carb intake. This is because carbs are a rapidly available fuel for your body, and if they’re present in high enough quantities, your body will switch back to burning carbs instead of burning stored body fat ( 1 ). One tablespoon of apple cider vinegar contains about 3 calories and less than 1 gram of carbs. Therefore, it’s unlikely that it would affect your fast — unless you took it in large quantities, which can be unsafe ( 2 ). Taking apple cider vinegar while fasting seems to help fight cravings and hunger pangs. Plus, several studies have shown that adding vinegar to a meal helps increase feelings of fullness ( 3 , 4 , 5 ). Studies have also noted associations between vinegar intake, improved blood sugar levels, and reduced weight ( 5 , 6 ). While many of these studies weren’t conducted among fasted people, they suggest that apple cider vinegar may help combat hunger and promote steady blood sugar levels, both of which are useful during a fast. Summary Apple cider vinegar contains only trace amounts of carbs and is therefore unlikely to negatively affect your fast. Furthermore, it may help you feel more full and maintain your blood sugar levels.  How much can you have while fasting? To reap some of the potential benefits of apple cider vinegar, less is more. Taking 1–2 tablespoons (15–30 mL) daily should be sufficient, as taking too much can lead to some unpleasant side effects like tooth enamel erosion ( 7 ). Alternatively, you can take apple cider vinegar capsules, which contain dehydrated vinegar. With these, it’s best to stick to the recommended serving size on the supplement label. However, you may want to avoid apple cider gummies and drinks while fasting. There’s no guarantee these products won’t kick you out of ketosis, as they often contain added sugar and calories. Summary Stick to 1–2 tablespoons (15–30 mL) of apple cider vinegar per day. You can also take apple cider vinegar capsules instead, but gummies and drinks should be avoided while fasting.  Is it best to dilute it? Apple cider vinegar should be diluted before consumption. That’s because vinegar is extremely acidic, and exposure to large amounts of undiluted vinegar can erode your tooth enamel, as well as irritate your esophagus and the lining of your digestive tract ( 7 , 8 ). One study in healthy adults noted tooth erosion was present after just 8 weeks of taking 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of vinegar diluted in 1 cup (240 mL) of water twice daily. For this reason, it may be wise to dilute the vinegar even more than this ( 7 ). Try diluting at most 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of vinegar into 8 ounces (240 mL) of water to make it safer to drink. If it’s still too strong for your taste, you can dilute it even further. If you’d like to protect your teeth even more from the vinegar’s acidity, you can drink the diluted apple cider vinegar with a straw or take it in capsule form. Summary You should dilute apple cider vinegar before drinking it. It’s very acidic and can damage your tooth enamel and digestive tract. You can dilute 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of apple cider vinegar into 1 cup (240 mL) of water.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Apple Arcade expanded its offerings this month in a big way. The evolving service added more than 30 games at the beginning of April, and the offerings feature heavy hitters that will make core gamers take notice.  It’s a notable mix of mobile classics such as “Monument Valley” and established blockbusters like “NBA 2K21 Arcade Edition.” The company even added titles based on timeless pastimes such as chess and crossword puzzles. The diverse portfolio caters to a broad audience and makes the $4.99-per-month subscription service an enticing offer. It also brings up the question: If Apple builds it, will gamers come?  A BROAD REACH  The new additions are a sign that Apple is casting a wider net for the service. An older generation may like the idea of the Timeless Classics category. Think of it as the service’s version of Nintendo’s surprisingly great “Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics.” It creates virtual versions of backgammon, crossword puzzles and solitaire.  The versions of these games are made by third-party developers, but some offerings have twists on the classics. For example, “Really Bad Chess” by Zach Gage upends the concept of rooks, knights and queens by creating imbalance.  “People are fascinated by chess but the pristine fairness turns people off,” Gage said. “It’s the idea of fairness. We want the rules of the game to be fair.”  But what gives the games drama is unfairness. He mentioned the idea of underdogs and David and Goliath. “We like it better when there’s unfairness.”  To create more interesting scenarios in “Really Bad Chess,” Gage creates boards where you have four queens and four knights and your opponent has a bunch of pawns. He mixes the pieces up. At the beginning, players have an overpowered hand, but as players improve at the game, it becomes more challenging as the board tilts against them.  “It’s sacrilegious but faithful to the feel of playing it,” he said.  OLD FAVORITES RETURN  A second group of people targeted by the service may have been raised on mobile games or have turned into gaming fans since the App Store opened back in 2008. These are people who love “Angry Birds” or “Crossy Road.” For this audience, Apple Arcade created another category called App Store Greats.  The offerings here have a distinct feel. These are games built for mobile and take advantage of iPhone and iPad touch screens. That means they’re easy to pick up and play while being great for bite-size fun. Players don’t need to block out an afternoon to play them. The levels are short and the experience is good enough to make that commute home on the train go by quickly.  App Store Greats include the likes of “Threes!” The original number slider game is addictive and the type of puzzle game that players can spend hours mastering. Meanwhile, “Fruit Ninja Classic” was one of the games that showed off the potential of the iPhone’s touch-screen interface, making a game that’s easy to learn by using your finger to cut melons like a ninja.  Although these games have been hits, “Monument Valley” is the title that’s instantly recognizable and is one of the defining projects on the platform. It’s been downloaded 73 million times and comes to Apple Arcade with all the bells and whistles.  It’s one of the advantages of the subscription services. It has no ads or additional add-on expenses. What players get is a complete experience with no other strings attached. What this means for “Monument Valley” is that on Apple Arcade it includes downloadable content such as Ida’s Dream and Forgotten Shores.  That approach to gaming is almost a throwback to the old console days. Before titles could be patched if there was something wrong with them, they came out complete on disc and cartridges. Players didn’t have to worry about buying expansion packs to play with their friends or continue the story. The game came in a box, it worked and players enjoyed a finished experience.  A BIG SHOUTOUT TO CORE GAMERS  That kind of approach will appeal to core and longtime gamers, which Apple Arcade is courting with its Apple Originals. It’s not a new category on the service per se but it is reloaded with a number of titles that will appeal to this crowd.  Platinum Games, the makers of hits such as “Bayonetta” and “NieR: Automata,” released “World of Demons.” It looks like the cult favorite “Okami” and that shouldn’t be a surprise seeing as the game’s director Hideki Kamiya was a studio co-founder. “Demons” brings a console feel with its quick-twitch button-mashing swordplay but it does have mobile elements such as the bite-size confrontations and levels. Best of all it works with a controller, for that console feel on mobile.  For older gamers, “The Oregon Trail” may be a good afternoon diversion. The visuals and a few gameplay mechanics have been revamped, but it’s essentially the same game that fans played on the Apple II computer. Players will appreciate the beautiful graphics that are light years ahead of the green-and-black images they saw in their childhood.  Fans of “Final Fantasy” should check out Mistwalker’s “Fantasian.” It’s a role-playing game that reunites series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi and composer Nobuo Uematsu. What’s notable about this RPG is that the scenery is made via real-life dioramas, over which the characters are placed. It’s an unusual blending of practical and computer-generated effects that combine to tell a spellbinding story mixed with combat mechanics.  While all those games will pique core gamers’ interest, the one that may find the biggest audience is “NBA 2K21 Arcade Edition.” This is by all accounts a full version of the core game. It has all the NBA teams, multiplayer and MyCareer. It works with a controller or touch-screen controls.  Parts of the game such as MyCareer are stripped down a bit. It still has the basketball RPG feel but the story is told through voice narration instead of cutscenes.  What’s notable is that being an Apple Arcade game, there are no microtransactions. That’s something that the console versions are packed with. That makes the Apple Arcade game feel like a purer version of the experience. Players just tap on the game’s icon and play without worrying about spending additional money. VC is still in the game but it’s awarded like normal points that go toward improving a character. Players won’t pay more money to power up their avatar; instead, that occurs through normal campaign play.  As for online modes, Tyler Nation, vice president and head of mobile at 2K, said that Visual Concepts tried to make matchmaking fair by pitting players on controllers against players on controllers and players using Macs going up against players on Macs. Online play is a big draw of the franchise.  All of these additions gives Apple Arcade a roster of more than 180 games. It’s a catalog that’s more attractive than before and is part of a bigger trend. Gaming companies such as Microsoft are investing in subscription services of their own and buying studios and making deals for that content. It’s part of a process that will make the gaming scene five years from now look more like Netflix.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'September: Apple Watch and iPad. October: HomePod and iPhone. November: The Apple Silicon Macs. March: Crickets. But April, dear sweet April…  Now, I know some people are saying Apple doesn\\'t host April events. They haven\\'t done that in a decade ever since… iPhone OS4 in 2010. But in case you hadn\\'t noticed, 2020/2021 are like Justice League and the Snyder Cut, and none of the old rules apply anymore. Does this mean Apple needs an event? No, absolutely not. Especially if they\\'re for iterative or upgrade products that are super easy to understand, barely an inconvenience. But if there are things that are new, things that are novel, things that require an explanation, it is just always better for Apple to do that in an event, especially now that they\\'re hosting virtual events. VPN Deals: Lifetime license for $16, monthly plans at $1 & more And it could be as soon as April sixth. Apple TV  So let\\'s say we start with the Apple TV. The biggest question right now is whether it would be one of those iterative updates. An A12X processor just crammed into the current box. So that box can better support things like compositing HDR content and the latest generation of Apple arcade games. With an updated Siri remote that is just better, hopefully in every way, including with the U1 chip in it so that we can find it if, and when it inevitably gets lost under the sofa, in the sofa cushions. Also rumored is an actual Apple gaming controller, a gamepad. The more audacious rumors are for a much higher-end Apple TV, one with an A14X processor, which would be roughly equivalent in power to what is currently in the M1 Macbook Air and Macbook Pro, something that would signal Apple taking entertainment, not just more seriously but gaming much, much more seriously maybe up to and including investing in AAA games and gaming studios. And I think that\\'s one of those things where I\\'m gonna invoke the \"I\\'ll expect it when I see it\" clause because even an A14X just wouldn\\'t have Xbox Series S or Series X or PlayStation 5 GPU power, at least not as we currently imagine it. So, balancing the amount of performance with the expectations of a much harder-core gaming audience with what Apple is capable of delivering in terms of gaming experience… that would be a neat trick. iPad Pro  For the iPad Pro, rumor has it that the larger version, not the 11-inch but the 12.9-inch version, at the very least, might get a mini-LED display. Mini-LED is an improved version of LCD, thanks to technologies like local dimming zones giving you deeper shadows, brighter highlights, and much wider contrast ratios. Things that are closer to OLED without also having to mitigate all the negative aspects of OLED. Also rumored is an A14X system-on-a-chip (SoC) that would be almost identical to the M1 in the current Macbook Air, Macbook Pro, and Mac mini. Just without the Mac-specific IP like virtualization and x86 translation acceleration. The other advantage of the M1 chip is it has those two dedicated Thunderbolt controllers onboard. So whether Apple just makes an A14X specific chipset with one Thunderbolt port or uses the M1 and only enables one of those Thunderbolt ports, that\\'s really an implementation detail, but either way, I would love, like all caps LOVE, having Thunderbolt on the iPad, not just for the displays that require Thunderbolt, but for the much much higher speed storage. Things that I use every day for doing videos like this, that I would love to be able to Thunderbolt right into the iPad Pro. Also, 5G, thanks to a Qualcomm modem, which will be great for people who just love Qualcomm modems but also for people in China or North America and Europe who have actual good 5G deployments with higher speeds, lower congestion, and everyone else will just do exactly what Verizon support suggested, and that is to curse its battery drain and turn it right off. iPad mini?'},\n",

       "  'text': \"Apple announced this week that the Worldwide Developer Conference will be held on June 7 -- once again as a virtual event. The announcement comes just as speculation is peaking about a possible Apple hardware event this month.  What hardware might be in store this April? Rumors are focused on a vastly upgraded iPad Pro line featuring a system on a chip (SoC) with performance comparable to the current generation MacBook Pro's M1 processor. While this chip is rumored to be called A14X (a version bump in name from the chip in the iPhone 12 and iPad Air), the actual architecture -- in terms of the overall arrangement and count of large and small cores, the amount of onboard cache, the GPU, and NPU configuration -- is expected to be very similar to the M1.  ZDNet Recommends The best iPad models Follow along as we break down each iPad model. Read More  The existential iPad Pro  Where the chips and the hardware are expected to differ (in addition to the iPad Pro's native touchscreen capabilities) may be in the area of memory performance and additional circuitry needed on the Mac for more complex I/O, such as for high-performance solid-state drives that the iPad doesn't use. But, in all other respects, with the new generation of iPad Pros that are likely to be released shortly, the A14X will be at parity with the Mac's M1 in everything but name. Ultimately, what may end up separating the iPad Pro and the Mac may come down to software.  This brings us to our next question: If the hardware of an iPad Pro and a lower-end MacBook Pro or a MacBook Air is now at parity, just what is the difference between an iPad Pro and a MacBook, anyway?  If we assume that the iPad Pro 2021 has 8GB or 16GB of RAM, and comparable cores, GPU, and NPU horsepower to a comparable MacBook Air or MacBook Pro with an M1, then the forthcoming iPad Pro now outstrips the capabilities of any application that currently runs on iPadOS -- it's overkill and begging to be exploited.  Catalyst, the third generation  Perhaps Apple intends to run an entirely new generation or class of apps on the iPad Pro. But where are all these apps going to come from? Presumably, they are going to come from the Mac.  This, I believe, is where we'll see some exciting developments at WWDC 2021. We can expect that Cupertino will roll out the third iteration of Catalyst, the development framework used to port iPad and iOS apps to the Mac's Apple Silicon platform. To date, however, Catalyst has not seen significant adoption among Mac software developers. Why? For starters, the Rosetta x86 emulation simply runs too damn well, so developers are taking their sweet time in porting over large Mac apps to Apple Silicon, whether it is with the native Cocoa API framework using x86 Mac codebases or iPad codebases with Catalyst.  The other issue: The level of effort needed to port iPad apps over to the Mac for negligible developer return on investment. Let's face it, the iOS and iPadOS ecosystems are highly lucrative; that is where the money is for the majority of Apple's developer base. The big developers with big Mac apps, such as Adobe and Microsoft, already have Apple Silicon ports in progress. And those are few and far between compared to the hundreds of thousands of iOS and iPadOS apps in the App Store.  Where things are likely to get interesting are ports in the other direction: Mac to iPad. And, to do this, Apple needs to make Catalyst the unifying API glue between both platforms so that all future development - whether on iPad or Mac -- becomes a single developer target.  Apple: Going beyond Silicon  Apple has some important existential decisions to make. Now that it is almost ready to abandon the Intel x86 architecture on all Mac systems, it's already halfway there. The next step in platform evolution goes beyond simply making Apple Silicon more powerful -- with even more general-purpose compute cores, the ability to stack more memory, more powerful GPUs, and more machine learning cores. It goes even further than building the chips needed to make the next generation of Mac Pros and higher-end MacBooks.  The next step beyond more powerful chips is determining which of their two desktop operating systems -- iPadOS or MacOS -- will be the future.  Today, MacOS is important because it is the platform that hosts the development environment for both iOS and iPadOS. In essence, the two most important revenue generators for the company are just Mac's vassal states. But suppose Apple merges select Mac APIs with Catalyst succeeding Cocoa as Mac's preferred development framework. In that case, the only real difference between an iPad and a Mac will just be the default user interface. At that point, the iPad could become a self-hosting environment if XCode were ported to it, even if it was limited to Catalyst as its development target.  In the past, Apple has made statements that it has no intention of merging the MacOS and iPad platforms. But what if that is just semantics? What if iPadOS is evolving into the replacement for the Mac?  iPad and Mac: The next 10 years  Whether iPadOS replaces the Mac or the MacOS becomes more iPad-like is simply a means to an end. The result is the same: A future in which Catalyst becomes the development environment for all Apple platforms.  We've already seen some of MacOS controls (such as the notification center and control panel) and built-in apps ported over from iPad using Catalyst, including the Apple News app, Apple Maps, Messages, TV, Music, and a few others. However, It may not make sense for MacOS to become even more iPad-like, at least if we are talking about porting over all of the touch interface libraries and frameworks. The effort required to make the MacOS fully touch-enabled would rival the porting of MacOS to Apple Silicon itself. There's a lot of legacy code in there that would be a heck of a mess to untangle and replace.  However, we already know that MacOS 11 can run iPad apps natively without any form of emulation. They use mouse and keyboard input to emulate touch, provided that the application developer publishes it to the App Store. But some developers, such as Google and Facebook, have refrained from doing that, ostensibly because it might affect their ad revenue generation capabilities.  Instead of making the Mac run more like the iPad, Apple could do the opposite. The company could take things further with the new iPad Pro by allowing existing Apple Silicon or even x86 Rosetta applications to run without modification. Apple could create a stripped-down Mac runtime environment that executes under its containerization and virtualization engine used on the Apple Silicon version of MacOS 11 -- something that to date has not been well-documented or exposed to developers. It simply just runs.  It would be a quick and easy way for beefier iPad Pros to take advantage of all that extra horsepower. The Mac apps in question would have to be distributed on the App Store rather than traditional Mac installation methods, but there's no technical reason why it could not be done.  Of course, this brings us to the most likely end-state for Mac: An entirely App Store-driven ecosystem. A closed system where all monetization goes through App Store.  Eventually, once all x86 Rosetta apps are ported to native Apple Silicon, and the entire library of apps in the App Store are either Cocoa (which, at some point, is likely going to merge into Catalyst a few years down the line) or native Catalyst, both platforms can then be merged into one.  Will the Mac become more iPad-like, losing some of its legacy code in the process, or will iPadOS take on Mac's attributes to accommodate professional user demands, such as with the ability to run windowed interfaces? Once the development targets become identical, the differences between the two systems become mostly cosmetic -- and I feel that an entirely new brand for the operating system that replaces both systems will end up being what runs our Apple desktop apps 10 years from now.  Does the Mac become more iPad-like, or will the iPad become more like the Mac? Talk Back and Let Me Know.\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'These are a throwback to my school days, where we would stop by Percy Ingle or Greggs on the way home and grab something sweet – an iced bun, an apple slice or mini doughnuts (I’m a sucker for anything glazed). The great thing about these buns is that the apples stay crunchy on top, contrasting with the soft texture of the bun. And, of course, they’re finished with a drizzle of lemon icing, to give them that old-school vibe.  Iced apple buns  Here, I’ve paired a really simple bun dough with spiced brown sugar butter and apples.  Prep 1 hr 15 min  Prove 2 hr+  Cook 18 min  Makes 6  50ml whole milk  100ml water  3g fast-action dried yeast  225g strong white flour  15g sugar  3g fine salt  25g unsalted butter, softened  Oil, for greasing  1 beaten egg, for brushing  For the apples  80g unsalted butter, softened  40g dark brown sugar  ½ tsp ground cinnamon  180g braeburn apples, peeled, cored and cut into 1cm cubes  For the icing  70g icing sugar mixed with the juice of ½ lemon    Warm the milk and water very gently and slowly, so it’s warm to the touch. Sprinkle in the yeast, stir and set aside.  Mix the flour, sugar and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Pour the wet mix over the dry, and mix on a medium speed with a dough hook for 10 minutes. Turn off the machine and cover with a tea towel for five minutes.  Add the butter and mix on slow-medium speed until incorporated. Turn the machine up to medium and mix and develop to give the dough strength – it should be smooth, silky and elastic.  Scoop out the dough on to a work surface and shape into a smooth ball. Pop into a large, lightly greased bowl, cover and leave to double in size for one and a half to two hours.  Meanwhile, in a second large bowl, mix the butter, dark brown sugar and cinnamon until soft and well combined, then stir through the chopped apple.  Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/gas 6. When the dough has doubled in size, press it down and divide into 65g portions. Roll into balls and put on baking trays, spacing them well apart, so they won’t touch each other when growing and baking (so, about three per small tray).  Lightly oil the tops and cover with a tea towel. After about 25 minutes, when the dough balls are puffy and light, push down the middles, spoon 30-40g of the apple mixture into each bun and press down gently. Gently brush the exposed dough on each bun with beaten egg.  Bake for 15-18 minutes, until golden. The apples should absorb the butter mixture and remain slightly firm, but if any fall off during baking, spoon them back on. Leave to cool slightly, then drizzle over the lemon icing. These are best eaten on the day they are made.'},\n",

As Indiana Jones famously said: “You eat ‘em!” He was not, however, talking about calendar dates, which is what the Macalope is talking about, so he doesn’t know why he brought that up. Also, some of those dates were later poisoned. So forget the Macalope brought that up.  Recently, there was a bit of a kerfuffle—a to-do, if you will—a happening, but not the dumb kind involving killer plants. A different dumb kind involving Apple rumors. There were rumors that Apple was planning an event for March 23 in which it would announce new iPads and the long-rumored AirTags, which have been so long-rumored the Macalope will only believe they are real when he sees them. And possibly not even then.  Fool me 12 times, Apple.  Now, not only was this event rumored, but the rumor mongers were so sure it was happening that several said it was “confirmed” and one even said it was so confirmed that he’d shave his eyebrows off if it didn’t happen.  Guess what happened?!  Well, a big ship got stuck in the Suez Canal for days, but there was no Apple event on the 23rd. That is not a thing that happened. The eyebrow shaving is a thing that happened, however. Because integrity in the Apple rumor biz means actually shaving the body parts you said you’d shave.  Now, the Macalope has heard hints that Apple may indeed have actually planned to have an event on the 23rd and postponed it for one reason or another. But such are the vicissitudes of betting your facial hair that Apple events are “confirmed”. They’re not really confirmed until the invitations go out.  People like to razz Apple about products that didn’t ship or shipped “late” when a release date was never publicly announced. But Apple’s internal dates are not promises. If an editor asks the Macalope how many words his column is going to be and the Macalope thinks to himself, “800,” but then he also thinks to himself, “On the other hand, writing takes time and there are many good shows on TV to watch these days. Such as the historically incorrect space show and the show with the birdman and the man who stares. Perhaps 600 is enough words.” So he says to the editor, “600,” and the editor says, “Great!” That does not mean The Macalope missed the word count of 800 by only writing 600.  See how that works?  Apple has certainly missed announced dates before. It missed more than one release date for OS X versions in the 2000s and more recently in 2017 it announced that the AirPower charging mat would be coming the next year and not only did that not happen but the company scrapped the whole project two years later. (Side note: While Apple apparently couldn’t pull off a “place up to three devices anywhere” charging mat, Xiaomi apparently has, albeit three years later. Of course, it’s possible that Xiaomi doesn’t care quite as much as Apple does about how hot the mat gets, but it’s almost certain that at $90 it’s substantially cheaper than what Apple was going to charge. At that price, you could probably buy two and just move your devices back and forth to keep the mats cool.)  There’s missing a date and then there’s missing a date and flipping the whole table over.  Wait, was Apple possibly expecting something to be delivered somewhere on that cargo ship, thus necessitating moving the event? Well, the Macalope’s not betting his eyebrows on it. Even with the amount of excess fur he’s got.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'NEW YORK, NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 20: Apple CEO Tim Cook greets customers at the grand reopening of Apple\\'s flagship Apple Fifth Avenue retail store on September 20, 2019 in New York City. Taylor Hill | WireImage | Getty Images  The digital advertising world is scrambling to prepare for a seismic change when Apple updates its iPhone software in the coming weeks. The move, called App Tracking Transparency, or ATT, will force app makers to ask permission before they can collect a unique identifier on every iOS device called an identifier for advertisers, or IDFA. A significant proportion of users are expected to say no. Today, developers and advertisers use the IDFA to target mobile ads and measure how effective they are. Apple has consistently said that the change to its platform, announced last June, is about privacy. However, digital advertising professionals say there could be a side benefit for Apple: Increased power over its App Store, giving Apple more control over the kinds of apps that get popular and gross millions through the store. In particular, it could make it harder for app makers to draw consumers to download their apps through in-app advertisements. That could help Apple instead guide consumers to the apps that it chooses to highlight in the App Store for its own business purposes. For instance, Apple could highlight more games that charge through subscriptions, where Apple gets an ongoing cut, and fewer casual social games that monetize heavily through in-app purchases, which could detract from the overall iOS gaming experience and harm Apple\\'s brand. The move could also boost Apple\\'s own Search Ads, which are ads for app downloads that appear directly inside the App Store. Apple\\'s App Store and advertising business are both reported as part of its services business, which the company has highlighted to investors as a growth engine. It generated revenue of $53.8 billion in fiscal 2020, up 16% from the previous year. \"Apple has been able to stake out the moral high ground, I think, claiming that they\\'re focused on user privacy. But in reality, they really surrendered app discovery to and merchandising to Facebook and Google. What I see them doing is trying to get that control back,\" said Brian Bowman, CEO of Consumer Acquisition, a digital advertising firm focusing on user acquisition. When contacted for comment, Apple reiterated its commitment to privacy. \"We believe privacy is a basic human right and that users should have transparency and choice about how their data is collected and used. We\\'ve invested in privacy-preserving technologies for decades, with Intelligent Tracking Prevention in Safari, Privacy Labels on the App Store, Sign in with Apple, and App Tracking Transparency. Our privacy features apply to all developers — including Apple. But users won\\'t see App Tracking Transparency prompts from Apple because we don\\'t track users.\"  How app install ads work  For years, many of the apps that have topped Apple\\'s App Store charts have been supercharged by a marketing strategy designed to target users who are most likely to spend. Companies such as Facebook, Google, and TikTok sell app install ads. They usually show up within other apps as a pop-up or an item inside a feed. When users click on the ad, they\\'re brought to a page in the App Store to download the advertised app. App install ads are a core part of the user acquisition strategy for many companies, especially e-commerce companies and casual games that rely on getting a small fraction of users to buy lots of add-ons within the game. These users are sometimes known as \"whales.\" An estimate from AppsFlyer, which makes advertising software for app makers, said app makers will spend $96.5 billion on app install ads in 2021, or about a third of total mobile spending on ads. That\\'s because they\\'re effective. Sensor Tower, an analytics firm monitoring app stores, published a study on Thursday finding that referrals from other apps drove 20% of new app installs on the App Store in 2020. The only larger source was direct searches on the App Store, which accounted for 59% of installs.  A mockup of the popup window iPhone users will see before using an app that tracks their data. This image was provided by Apple. Apple  App install ads are often sold by price-per-install, ranging from pennies to tens of dollars. Typically, the ad buyers will estimate how much a customer in a given demographic might spend throughout their time using the app and make a simple mathematical judgment. If the price-per-install is less than the estimated lifetime value of the people those ads are targeting, then the app maker buys as many of those ads as it can afford. The ATT change, and other Apple privacy tweaks, threaten this model by drastically reducing the amount of information that marketers have about how effective their ads are. Without that information, app marketers can\\'t tell if they are getting the right people to install their apps. \"When you look at the companies who are investing $6 [million] to $20 million a month, every month for 18 months to get a payback, all that stuff becomes opaque very, very quickly, when Apple flips that switch,\" Bowman said. Casual gaming apps, which often appear on Apple\\'s Top Grossing charts, are most likely to be hurt. Games are a huge part of Apple\\'s App Store business, representing 65.8% of spending on the platform, according to a Sensor Tower estimate. For games, referrals are the top source for downloads, driving 38% of first-time installs in 2020 — more than people directly searching through the App Store, according to Sensor Tower. \"The primary growth strategy for most, if not all, mobile gaming companies is paid ads. There aren\\'t really any gaming companies that don\\'t utilize them,\" said Eric Seufert, the author of Mobile Dev Memo, who has a background in user acquisition for gaming companies. Unity, a company that makes gaming and advertising software for small developers to build on, warned in February that the IDFA change could change the \"way mobile game developers acquire customers and how they optimize lifetime customer value.\" Andre Kempe of Admiral Media, a marketing firm focused on mobile app publishers, believes that Apple\\'s change could force gamemakers to change the way their games work. Instead of relying on a few huge spenders, they might have to target larger numbers of people to spend smaller amounts. \"Once they realize, okay, I need to make money with this, then some product manager would say, okay, we need to put a payment screen somewhere in the first level, which you haven\\'t seen before, so the user experience will change a little bit,\" said Kempe.  Yes, Apple sells ads'},\n",

A recent leak that claims to have spilled a date of April 6, but that seems far-fetched for a couple of different reasons.  The leaked image from the r/Apple Discord says that Apple will be launching a new mini-LED iPad Pro 2021, a new iMac 2021 with a new design and Apple Silicon and \"refreshes\" of the regular iPad and iPad mini. Plus, we should expect the long-awaited arrival of the AirTags trackers.  All of these new Apple products could very well be on the way soon, but the date of the virtual event and the leaked image itself do not seem legit.  The r/Apple discord just posted this. Let’s see if it’s real, shouldn’t be too long. pic.twitter.com/SGJY4ZeEvTMarch 31, 2021 See more  The leaked invite’s use of “where to find us”, along with the circular graphics that look very similar to leaked AirTags designs, signal the AirTags presence at the April event.  However, people on Twitter have expressed doubts, particularly since it claims the event will happen at \\'10am PST\\'. As some have pointed out, California is currently on PDT, and Apple would have known that.  In addition, if the April 6 date were legit, we likely would have heard something by now, as Apple typically provides a week\\'s notice for its virtual events.  The Apple April event is set to see the launch of a new mini-LED iPad Pro, a new iMac 2021 with a new design and Apple Silicon and, according to the leak \"refreshes\" of the regular iPad and iPad mini.  For those that don’t know, AirTags are Apple’s answer to Tile and other tracking gadgets. The key difference, however, is that Apple will be utilizing ultra wideband (UWB) technology, instead of Bluetooth. That way the AirTags are able to transmit locational data, and give users a more precise location of where their lost property might be.  Rumors have also indicated that AirTags will be around the size of a 50 cent coin, and can attach to your stuff with some kind of adhesive. Naturally, a different leak suggests Apple will have a number of compatible AirTags accessories, letting you use the trackers as keyrings, wearables, or some other kind of not-sticky accessory.  The AirTags are rumored to be priced at $39 each, the same as the Samsung Galaxy Smart Tag Plus, but we’ll have to wait and see if that is true or not.  Apple hasn’t confirmed the date or time of the April event yet, and we won\\'t know what\\'s going on until it does. But if it really is happening soon, we should be hearing anytime now.'},\n",

       "  'text': \"Recently, Apple and Google each announced changes that will have the effect of limiting the ability of apps and websites to track users online and through mobile apps. Although the changes have yet to occur, marketers and advertisers need to start paying attention, as each will be heavily impacted by these upcoming changes.  Apple, Identifier for Advertisers, and Privacy Labels  Between Google’s and Apple’s announcements, the digital advertising and marketing industries are reeling, and Apple’s recent shift will impact the entire app experience. “App developers and marketers will need to make changes to focus on first-party data, building a strong and loyal customer base, and creating an experience that’s worth paying (or seeing ads) for,” said Justin Bauer, SVP of products at Amplitude, a product intelligence platform provider.  Essentially, Apple, which considers privacy to be a user’s right, now requires app developers to provide a disclosure as to how the app uses the data it collects from users. The “privacy labels” are broken into three categories: “data used to track you,” “data linked to you,” and “data not linked to you.” Data used to track you indicates that data from the app (personal information, or data collected from the mobile device, such as location data) is linked with other data for the purpose of targeted advertising. Sharing user or device information with brands that sell that data is also considered to be tracking. Data linked to you is any data that can be used to identify you, and includes data collected from using the app or having an account with the brand that created the app, and any data that is collected from the device that the app is installed on that can be used to create an advertising profile. Data not linked to you is defined as certain types of data, such as location data or browsing history, that is not being linked to the user in an identifiable manner.  Additionally, with iOS 14, Apple’s new IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers) rules will take effect, and users will have the ability to block the IDFA identifier at the app level. Not only that, but developers will be required to ask app users for explicit permission to track them across apps and websites using the IDFA. They will also have to provide details about what data is being collected, and who it is going to be shared with.  “Apple is taking positive steps in the name of user privacy with its new IDFA rules and mandated privacy labels, and the downstream effect will be felt not just by advertisers, but also by app developers,” said Bauer. “The move puts pressure on companies to up the ante on digital experiences. We’ll end up seeing that the winners in this new world won’t necessarily be the companies that are best at advertising; they’ll be the companies that deliver the best experiences.”  For those brands that already have a large number of customers that have the brand’s app installed on their iOS device, they will have a big lead over those brands who are just getting their apps on the market. “For example, in an industry like gaming we’ll see that the platforms that already have highly engaged customers will be able to leverage that existing audience to drive cross-share across new apps and games. This rule change will make it even harder for single publishers to grow their initial user base, but if you have an existing user base of highly engaged customers, you can tap into that first-party data and use it to your advantage. I expect we’ll see many more businesses leverage their existing offerings to cross-sell into new ones that they’re launching. On the other hand, businesses that don’t deliver on the product experience or adapt digital optimization will ultimately struggle,” Bauer emphasized.  Apple is likely hoping that advertisers and marketers will begin using its SKADNetwork, which is Apple’s privacy-friendly method of attributing ad impressions and clicks on iOS apps. SKADNetwork is able to share data with advertisers without revealing user-level or device-level data. It’s essentially Apple’s version of Google’s walled garden.  “These changes are going to significantly impact the retail advertising ecosystem. Apple calls this new initiative App Tracking transparency, which as the name implies, provides transparency to the iPhone user on how they are being tracked,” said Rob McGovern, founder of Careerbuilder and now PreciseTarget  Industry experts believe that many app users will opt out of the IDFA, which will heavily impact the ability of advertisers to target those users. “If an iPhone or iPad user opts-out of IDFA, he or she will no longer be a targetable person.” Also affected will be the ability of advertisers to geo-target app users. “Many data sets learn who you are by knowing the physical address of where your phone sleeps at night, and then ties your address to public name and address directories. Clearly, this will degrade the ability to geo-target consumers based on their home address.

Instead, Google is promoting the use of an interest-based advertising model called Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC). FLoC clusters large groups of people with similar interests so they can be targeted with relevant content and ads.  “Google is portraying their decision to eliminate 3rd party cookies in Chrome as enhancing consumer privacy, in truth, the devil is in the details,” said McGovern. “Google will continue to drop its 1st party cookie, enabling them to track and target you within their walled garden. How big is the garden? It includes search, Gmail, and YouTube, which means their garden is bigger than most farms.”  Although Google has issued statements that said that they are committed to protecting the privacy of users, including eliminating “any technology used for tracking individual people as they browse the web,” clearly that does not include their own properties.  “It's premature to begin thinking that Google has become a pro-consumer privacy company. Aside from continuing to track consumers using their first-party cookie, unlike Apple, they'll continue to track consumer locations on Android. Additionally, when Google says they don't harvest data from Google apps like Gmail, Photos, and Drive, it's notable they don't include Chrome on that list. The Chrome browser continues to be a tool used by Google to harvest consumer data,” suggested McGovern.  It is interesting that although Google is working to reduce the ways consumers are tracked on the web, it has not done anything to stop developers from doing the same thing via Android apps. “It should be noted that Google is not following Apple's lead on curtailing mobile tracking. Users of Android phones will continue to be location tracked, indicating the importance of location data to Google's ad platform,” McGovern said. “Additionally, users of Google Maps and Waze will continue to have their locations tracked. Google's 1st party cookie that's used on all their apps, including Google Maps, is becoming an incredibly potent tracking asset.”  Related Article: Google's FLoC Helps Bring Cookieless Marketing and Privacy Into Focus  Final Thoughts  Apple and Google are making changes to their policies in order to protect the privacy of their respective users, which will have the effect of limiting the ability of advertisers to target users as they browse the web or use mobile apps. Advertisers and marketers would be wise to begin looking into Apple’s SKADNetwork and FLoC as well as focusing on first party data collection going forward.\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'Apple is facing the prospect of a new class-action lawsuit after a judge decided the company knowingly sold defective MacBook Pro laptops.  The problems started back in 2016 when Apple launched the Touch Bar generation of MacBook Pro, and with it made a terrible internal design decision. The display was connected to its base using a very thin and flimsy ribbon cable, which was also wrapped around a hinge. Whenever the MacBook Pro was fully opened, this cable got pulled tight and over time it became damaged and ultimately failed.  iFixit revealed the design fault and ultimately it ended up being referred to as \"flexgate.\" For owners, the damage would first become apparent as a \"stage light\" effect at the bottom of the screen, with the backlight displaying in bands. Eventually the backlight would fail completely. At the time, Apple wouldn\\'t even talk about it, but instead quietly fixed the problem in 2019. This resulted in many MacBook Pro repairs costing customers around $600 for what was actually a $6 ribbon cable fault.  As 9To5Mac reports, Apple\\'s poor handling of the fault resulted in a lawsuit being filed, which inevitably escalated to seek class action lawsuit status. U.S. District Judge Edward Davila reviewed the application and has concluded Apple did knowingly sell defective laptops. As Law360 explains, Davila said, \"The court finds that the allegations of pre-release testing in combination with the allegations of substantial customer complaints are sufficient to show that Apple had exclusive knowledge of the alleged defect.\"  The judge did trim the proposed class action, removing claims Apple hid the defect, but will allow the inclusion of Apple deleting Official Apple Support Community posts complaining about the issue because it acts as further evidence Apple knew there was a defect.  The lawsuit only covers 15-inch models of the MacBook Pro because Apple did eventually offer a Display Backlight Service Program for the 13-inch models. For some reason the 15-inch models were not included in that program, but Apple may now be wishing they had been. Apple is already facing one class-action lawsuit over the MacBook butterfly keyboard problems, so its legal department is going to be kept very busy.'},\n",

       "  'text': \"Fall Detection is a crucial Apple Watch feature that has already saved many lives. It detects when you've had a hard fall, and if you are immobile for a minute after the fall, it'll automatically contact emergency services. Fall Detection is not enabled by default though, so we're going to show you how to make the most of this.  Does my Apple Watch support Fall Detection?  Fall Detection works on Apple Watch Series 4 or newer Apple Watch models. That includes Apple Watch Series 5, Apple Watch SE, and Apple Watch Series 6.  How to Set Up Fall Detection on Apple Watch  If you have one of the Apple Watch models mentioned above, let's start setting up Fall Detection.  Go to the Watch app on your iPhone. Head over to the My Watch tab. Tap Emergency SOS. Enable Fall Detection.  While this will enable Fall Detection, you need to set up your Medical ID to make sure that your Apple Watch can contact emergency services. This is where you can add people close to you as your emergency contacts as well, and these people will receive a text stating that you've called emergency services along with your location at the time of making the call. Follow these steps.  On your iPhone, go to Settings > Health > Medical ID. Now tap Create Medical ID. Tap add emergency contact and select the contacts that you want to ping in case of an emergency.  With that done, there's just one more step involved in making sure that your Apple Watch can contact emergency services. Follow these steps.  On your Apple Watch, go to Settings > Passcode. Now you need to enable Wrist Detection. If it's enabled already, then there's no need to change anything.  These steps will enable Fall Detection on your Apple Watch.  What happens when Fall Detection is triggered  Fall Detection will be triggered on your Apple Watch after a hard fall. If you don't move for a minute after the fall, the watch will start a 30-second countdown. Apple Watch also alerts you that it has detected a fall and you have an option. During these 30 seconds, the watch will tap you on the wrist and sound an alarm, which keeps increasing in volume, as well. The intention of the vibration is to make sure that you are unable to respond, and the alarm tries to let people near you know that you need help.  Once the countdown is over, the Apple Watch will contact emergency services and alert your emergency contacts.  Once the call goes through, the watch will play an audio message that informs the emergency services about your fall along with your location coordinates.  Where to check when Fall Detection was triggered  Apple's Health app logs all instances of hard falls, so if you want to check when Fall Detection was activated, you can go to the Health app on your iPhone and head over to the Health Data tab. Now you can tap Results to see your fall history.  For more tutorials, visit our How To section.  Will iPhone 12 mini become the affordable iPhone we've been waiting for?

       "  'text': 'Danielle Alvarez  http://Daniellemalvarezcooks.me  Her book – Always Add Lemon – is available NOW!  Recipe:  A simple apple galette  Not only is this my favourite rendition of apple in tart form, but what makes it even more perfect is that the entire apple gets used. Cores and skins are cooked into a syrup that glazes the finished tart and gives you the most beautiful sheen, which also tastes like apple. If you use a different fruit for this recipe, simply glaze with melted fruit jam for the same effect.  Try and find unwaxed, new-season apples for this recipe. My absolute favourite variety is one called crimson snow, and not just because of its romantic name. It’s fragrant, sweet and sour, and its skins are the most beautiful colour I have ever seen in an apple: an almost purple-pink crimson, as the name suggests. Use your favourite variety, or the best, freshest apple you can find here.  You can also swap out the apples for plums, peaches, apricots, nectarines, figs or whatever sliceable fruit you like. Replace the calvados with a liqueur flavoured with whatever fruit you’re using, such as kirsch for cherries.  Serves 8–10  1 quantity Flaky dough  1 kg (2 lb 3 oz) apples of your choice 1⁄2 tablespoon plain (all-purpose) flour 20 g (3⁄4 oz) butter  1 tablespoon lemon juice  15 g (1⁄2 oz) caster (superfine) sugar, plus 1 tablespoon extra  1 tablespoon calvados (optional)  1 egg, beaten with a splash of cream, full-cream (whole) milk or water  ice cream, Crème fraîche (page 239) or lightly whipped cream, to serve  Apple peel glaze  50 g (13⁄4 oz) caster (superfine) sugar  Follow the recipe to make the dough, then roll it out into a circular shape about 2 mm (1⁄8 in) thick and place it on a piece of baking paper. Refrigerate.  Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F) and place a baking stone on the middle shelf.  Next, prepare your apples by peeling, quartering and coring them. Place the peels and cores in a small saucepan with the sugar for the apple glaze. Add 300 ml (10 fl oz) water, cover with a lid and simmer over a medium heat for 15 minutes.  Take your apple quarters and cut each quarter into 6–8 thin slices. Keep the slices together so you can arrange them nicely on the dough.  Sprinkle the prepared dough with the flour then spread it out evenly over the base using your hand. Arrange the apple slices on top in whatever pattern looks nicest to you. Concentric circles always look good, starting from the outside in, making sure you tightly fill the space with fruit. (It will shrink and move as it cooks, so make sure you use plenty.) Leave a 2 cm (3⁄4 in) edge.  Melt the butter and mix in the lemon juice, sugar and calvados, if using. Spoon this mixture over the top of the apples only. Fold the edge of the dough up around the fruit. Brush the egg mixture over the folded edge of dough and sprinkle with the extra sugar. Try to land as much sugar as possible directly on the crust and as little as possible on the baking paper.  By this point, your apple peel glaze should be ready. Strain it into a clean saucepan and put it back on the stove to simmer and reduce until thickened and ‘glazy.’ You only need about a tablespoon or so.  Transfer the galette to the oven, sliding it onto the baking stone using the baking paper. Immediately reduce the oven temperature to 180°C (350°F) and bake for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, increase the temperature to 200°C (400°F) and continue baking for 20–30 minutes until the crust is beautifully golden and the apples are browned on the edges. At this stage, flip a baking tray upside down and carefully pull the galette onto the baking tray using the baking paper. Transfer to a wire rack to cool and, finally, pull the baking paper out from underneath. If you leave the paper underneath, the base of the galette will steam and go soft.  When cooled but still slightly warm, brush your apple glaze on top of the apples. Enjoy with ice cream, crème fraîche, lightly whipped cream or just on its own.  Flaky dough  Making good pastry requires some attention. It is so elegant in its simplicity, yet it gives a lot of people trouble. I think because it’s so simple it deceives people into thinking it is easy, so they rush through it and perhaps ignore certain points about temperature or handling. Simple does not necessarily mean quick or straightforward. Pastry might only have a few ingredients, but there are many variables. I’ve tried to explain in detail two of my most useful pastry recipes. One is for more rustic flaky galettes or pies, and the other is for lining tart moulds; it’s crisp and short. Read the recipes in full before you begin and pay attention to the details because they make all the difference.  Makes 345 g (12 oz), enough for 8–10 slices  65–80 ml (21⁄4–21⁄2 fl oz) cold water  100 g (31⁄2 oz) cold butter  170 g (6 oz) plain (all-purpose)  flour, plus extra  for dusting  1 teaspoon caster  (superfine) sugar  1⁄2 teaspoon salt  1 egg, beaten with a splash of cream, full-cream (whole) milk or water  The key to making good dough is to keep everything super, super cold. I usually measure out my water first and put it in the freezer. I will also cut my butter and just toss with the dry ingredients and put that bowl in the freezer too for about 5 minutes. You’ll also find what brand of butter works for you. A butter with a higher fat-to-liquid ratio is best, because it stays super hard even in warmer temperatures.  Once everything is very cold, begin to crumble the butter into the flour using your fingertips. Work the butter into the flour until you have bean-sized lumps. Begin to rub the dough between the palms of your hands as if trying to wipe your hands off. This is what creates those thin sheets of butter that form flaky layers. Add half the cold water and mix with your hands. Try not to stretch or knead the dough; you just want it to come together. At this stage, I like to dump it onto a bench so I can press the dough together. If it comes together easily without any dry, floury spots, then it has enough water. If there are some powdery, dry clumps, add a bit more water until everything comes together. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and press it into a disc. Rub the outside of the plastic wrap to create a smooth edge (this will help get a more even circle when rolling it out). Refrigerate to cool and rest for at least 30 minutes.  If you have a marble benchtop, that is ideal for rolling out pastry as it stays cold.  A wooden bench has the advantage of not being sticky. Whatever you have, try to find a space in your kitchen with enough flat surface to give you room to move. When the dough is still cold, but has warmed enough to be slightly pliable, dust it with flour. Roll the dough out from the centre in all directions, trying to keep the round shape as much as possible. I purposely wrote this recipe to give you enough extra dough so that you can roll it out wider than you need to then cut a neat round of dough, so don’t worry about the edges being cracked or uneven. Continue rolling and rotating the dough to ensure it doesn’t stick, until it reaches a diameter of 33 cm (13 in) and a thickness of 2 mm (1⁄8 in). Use a little extra flour when rolling to prevent it sticking, but don’t throw handfuls of flour at it. Trim the edges so you are left with a neat circle (but not too perfect). Gently roll the dough up on a rolling pin and place it on a piece of baking paper. Transfer the baking paper and dough to a round pizza pan. If you don’t have a pizza pan, you’ll just lift the baking paper straight onto a baking stone when ready to bake. This is when you will add your toppings.  As far as rolling up the edges, you can make flat folds or elaborate, decorative edges, but my preferred fold is a pretty crimp, which I always think makes the humble galette look much more professional, but if that’s not your vibe, make it rustic.  To make said crimp, start at any point along the edge and fold a small section over itself to create a crust about 2 cm (3⁄4 in) wide (I like a thick crust). Continue folding the dough over on itself to create a pretty fold. If you don’t want to bake the galette straight away, you can refrigerate it for up to 24 hours at this point, and a bit of chill time is preferred to help firm up the dough. Once you’ve added the topping, bake within the next few hours to prevent the crust from getting soggy.  You want to bake this in a hot oven, and by hot I mean 200–220°C (400–430°F). This is what gives you that gorgeous deep golden and caramelised crust. Before going into the oven, brush the edge with the egg wash. Transfer the galette to the oven, either on the pizza pan on top of the baking stone, or place the galette, still on its baking paper, directly on the stone. Drop the oven temperature to 180°C (350°F) and bake for 30 minutes. If you are using a pizza pan, carefully hold the pan with an oven mitt or tea towel (dish towel) and, holding the baking paper on the opposite side, slide the galette off the tray and place it directly on the baking stone. Increase the oven temperature to 200°C (400°F) and continue baking for 20–30 minutes until the crust and filling are golden. Once baked, flip a baking tray upside down and pull your galette, using the baking paper, off the stone and onto the tray. Transfer to a wire rack to cool and, finally, pull the baking paper out from underneath the galette. If you leave the baking paper underneath, the crust will steam and the pastry won’t be crisp.  Note:  You can also make the dough and freeze it, but you’ll need to defrost it overnight in the fridge before you use it.

The Apple Maven anticipates the Cupertino company’s upcoming earnings date and looks at historical stock price behavior following previous ones.  March 2021 is coming to an end and, with it, Apple’s fiscal second quarter.  In a matter of a few weeks, the Cupertino company will be releasing the results of the post-holiday period. The event can be meaningful for the stock, since Apple’s earnings date often serves as a catalyst to send the share price either higher or lower.  Apple's Investor Relations page. Apple  What is Apple’s earnings date?  Apple has not yet announced details of the fiscal second quarter event. However, history tells us that results should come out between April 27th and April 29th, likely on Tuesday or Thursday.  The press release usually crosses the wires after the closing bell, at around 4:30 p.m. EST. The earnings call follows about half an hour later, at 5 p.m. New York City time.  For the past three years (i.e. 12 quarters), Apple’s earnings dates have been distributed as follows:  Six times on Tuesday; twice on Wednesday; and four times on Thursday  Nine times during the last week of the month immediately following the end of the quarter; three times in the very first day of the following month.  Beating vs. lagging estimates  When a company reports earnings, investors pay attention to how close the financial results have been to Wall Street’s consensus. This is a crucial factor in determining what happens to the share price after earnings day.  Apple usually provides earnings guidance three months prior to releasing its results – although this has not happened since the start of the COVID-19 crisis. Therefore, the Cupertino company “sets its own bar”, and it usually does so conservatively.  Partly for this reason, Apple has topped revenue and EPS (earnings per share) expectations every single quarter since early 2017. The widest top- and bottom-line beats came in the most recent quarter, when the iPhone 12 helped to push results through the roof in the 2020 holiday quarter.  Share price behavior after earnings  Over the past few years at least, Apple stock price has moved more noticeably after the company’s earnings date.  The graph below shows the average daily returns in AAPL in the two weeks following the release of Apple’s financial results compared to all other days. Share price increased, on average, three times as much after earnings. Remember that, in all cases, Apple topped analysts’ estimates.  Average Daily Return in AAPL, 2 Weeks After Earnings Since 2018 DM Martins Research  To be clear, the chart above does not imply that Apple stock will likely rise after earnings. This has been the case recently. However, worse-than-expected financial performance going forward could just as well send shares in the other direction.  Twitter speaks  Just for fun, I proposed a pop quiz on Twitter: how many times has Apple failed to meet Wall Street’s estimated earnings recently? Below are the answers.

       "  'text': '“Data-Driven Thinking” is written by members of the media community and contains fresh ideas on the digital revolution in media.  Today’s column is written by Alex Bauer, head of product marketing at Branch.  Less than a month ago, on March 15, the Financial Times broke a remarkable story. A state-backed consortium known as the China Advertising Association representing more than 2,000 of the biggest names in Chinese tech, has been quietly testing a new standard called the China Advertising ID (CAID).  Normally, something like this wouldn\\'t be particularly newsworthy. The Chinese tech world is full of homegrown standards. But CAID represents something much bigger: it\\'s an overt attempt to bypass Apple\\'s upcoming AppTrackingTransparency (ATT) policy.  In other words, Chinese apps are basically forming a union and daring Apple to ban all of them at once.  It’s audacious. But how does CAID work, why is it different from typical attribution techniques and what might Apple do about this tricky situation? Let’s dive in.  How CAID works  Shared platform identifiers, such as the IDFA on iOS and the Google Advertising ID on Android, are perfectly suited to measuring digital ads. This is because the same ID is available for all events, so it\\'s simple to connect ad touches with conversions.  But after Apple\\'s ATT policy goes into effect, IDFAs will be unavailable in the vast majority of cases, which means these traditional measurement flows will break.  CAID is essentially an open standard intended to function as a drop-in IDFA replacement, and there are two key characteristics that appear tailor made for this purpose:    CAIDs are designed to be persistent . Unlike many other measurement techniques, the CAID process creates a universally unique identifier (UUID) value that can be stored and reused. There\\'s even functionality built into the spec to provide mappings between CAIDs when the algorithm receives updates for better accuracy.  CAIDs can be generated by any participating company. Even though a CAID isn\\'t attached to the device at a hardware or OS level, following the same process to generate a CAID multiple times on the same device will (in theory) generate the same identifier each time. While this isn\\'t as accurate as a platform identifier like the IDFA, it is the next best thing and can be used in most of the same ways.  In a nutshell, CAID harvests an array of metadata parameters from the device and combines them in order to generate an identifier that is most likely \"unique enough\" for the purposes of ad measurement.  How a CAID is made  The technical process to generate a CAID is fairly simple:    1. Collect data parameters from the device. The CAID documentation provides sample code methods for app developers to do this, though it would also be quite simple to integrate the process into various third-party SDKs in future.  2. Send collected parameters to an API endpoint. The data is serialized and encrypted before transmission. Today, the API endpoint is owned and operated by the China Advertising Association, although this could change in future to be multiple API endpoints implementing the same spec or possibly even local generation on the device.  3. API returns a CAID value. This value can then be used in place of an IDFA for purposes such as attribution.  This process takes place wherever a CAID is called for, meaning both advertiser and publisher apps would perform the same steps.  Although I won\\'t get into it here, it’s important to point out that there are some obvious concerns related to fraud that will need to be addressed if this spec survives through to real world implementation.  Example device parameters used for CAID generation, from the CAID spec document.  The CAID spec fits all the criteria of a \"fingerprint ID,\" which is hardly a new concept in the digital ecosystem.  IDs of this sort have long been used for web-based tracking, and the reason we haven\\'t seen widespread adoption in mobile apps is mainly because they’ve been largely unnecessary. Platform identifiers like the IDFA provided the same benefits, but with more reliability.  But here’s the mind-blowing thing: What\\'s unique about CAID isn\\'t the technical implementation – it\\'s that Apple\\'s AppTrackingTransparency policy appears to have provided the catalyst to get the entire Chinese mobile industry to cooperate on a shared implementation.  How is CAID different from traditional mobile attribution?  Prior to iOS 14, IDFAs were a primary attribution method for mobile measurement providers (MMPs) – although there have always been situations where IDFAs weren\\'t available, such as when users had Limit Ad Tracking enabled or a web click on an ad led to an app install.  In these situations, MMPs typically fell back on probabilistic matching techniques, which were often colloquially termed \"fingerprinting\" for convenience.  While this might sound a bit similar to CAID, there\\'s a key difference: MMPs never used these techniques to generate persistent identifiers. The basic ad attribution process can be done more efficiently, and with less risk to user privacy, via the simple, point-in-time matching of basic event metadata, like IP addresses. There was simply no need for MMPs to create a unique identifier that looked like CAID, and after the attribution decision was complete, all of the event metadata could be safely discarded.  Unfortunately, Apple has made it clear that even these point-in-time techniques, while far less invasive than CAID, are still considered forbidden under the new ATT policy.  What happens next?  At a technical level, it must be admitted that CAID is quite an elegant solution. It\\'s a great example of a cooperative spec that likely never even would have gotten off the ground without Apple pushing everyone out of the boat first.  For its part, Apple obviously anticipated that fingerprinting-based IDFA workarounds would pop up, and therefore took care to also address these techniques in their ATT policy. CAID perfectly fits Apple’s definition of a \"fingerprint ID,\" which was explicitly called out as prohibited during WWDC last year.  Once the CAID news broke, examples of warnings sent to Chinese developers by Apple quickly started to follow:  Example of warning from App Store review, based on use of CAID.  Re: CAID, I was just shown an app update rejection for a Chinese app for collecting system information used to construct a persistent identifier. I asserted that Apple would not apply a separate standard for ATT compliance for Chinese companies, and it appears that it isnt pic.twitter.com/w0EtQj0vTe — Eric Seufert (@eric_seufert) March 18, 2021  The code methods Apple references in these warnings directly correlate to the pre-provided data collection functions in the CAID implementation documents, and the language leaves no doubt as to how Apple feels about this kind of workaround.  We likely won\\'t know the outcome until after iOS 14.5 is released and Apple has built up some ATT enforcement precedent, but here are the two possible extremes:  Apple successfully cracks down and CAID goes away. This is clearly what Apple is shooting for – but taking on the entire Chinese tech ecosystem, along with its implicit state sponsorship, may end up being a bigger bite than Apple has the stomach for.  Apple decides to abandon the whole ATT initiative. If CAID manages to get a foothold in China, it would set a precedent for ATT workarounds that could make it impossible for Apple to enforce the policy in a consistent manner globally.  While Apple probably can\\'t afford to ignore a direct mandate from the Chinese government – if it gets to that point, of course – a public implosion of the ATT initiative would be disastrous for the pro-privacy brand image Apple is trying to build.  The more likely outcome is some sort of behind-the-scenes compromise, where Apple makes a few token enforcement moves and then turns a blind eye … so long as no one pushes the boundaries too far.  This would not be the first example of a selective double standard on App Store policy enforcement, especially for the Chinese market. One obvious template for this would be the way in which WeChat is allowed to run its own \"app store\" and benefit from far looser standards for in-app payment processing, both of which are technically against the App Store guidelines.  The most unfortunate part is that the real victims in all this are end users.  Although the IDFA-based system definitely had problems, Apple still had leverage and could have chosen to iterate toward a better alternative. Instead, Apple decided to blow up the status quo and start over.  If CAID or something like it is ever implemented, it could be just the first example that Apple’s ATT crackdown may have simply pushed bad behavior underground.

       "  'text': 'LG announced Monday that it would be closing its mobile business unit.  The decision shows how difficult it is to challenge market leaders Apple and Samsung.  Samsung established itself as an early challenger to Apple, setting it up for long-term success.  See more stories on Insider\\'s business page.  LG is officially bowing out of the smartphone market.  The South Korean tech giant announced on Monday that it was exiting the \"highly competitive\" smartphone business by closing its mobile unit, which signaled the end of an era for a company that was once a top-tier handset maker.  Its decision underscores how difficult it is to compete with industry giants like Samsung and Apple, particularly in the US, which is part of the third-largest smartphone market.  LG was once among the top five smartphone makers. But it failed to stand its ground as Samsung and Apple dominated the US market and companies like Huawei and Xiaomi snatched up market share abroad.  Together, Apple and Samsung account for 81% of the US smartphone market, with Apple accounting for 65% and Samsung responsible for 16% as of the fourth quarter of 2020, according to Counterpoint Research. LG, meanwhile, came in third with just 9% of the market, and Samsung and Apple were the only two smartphone companies to show growth in the US during the fourth quarter of 2020.  Worldwide, Apple took the No. 1 spot in the fourth quarter of 2020 with 23.4% of the market, while Samsung came in second with 19.1%, according to the International Data Corp.  Samsung and LG are longtime rivals in the electronics and home-appliances industries, but there\\'s one critical advantage the former has that the latter lacks when it comes to smartphones.  Samsung established its phones as the primary competitors to the iPhone when the smartphone market was still fairly young in 2012. Back then, it had a blockbuster hit on its hands with the Galaxy S3, which overtook the iPhone 4S to become the best-selling smartphone in 2012, according to Strategy Analytics.  The Galaxy S3\\'s successful launch helped shape a narrative that the smartphone market had become a two-horse race between Apple and Samsung. It fueled headlines in outlets like The New York Times, Vanity Fair, and The Guardian declaring the two tech giants as the winners of what had become the biggest shift in computing in recent history.  No Android phone maker had anything that came close to the popularity of the Galaxy S3 at the time. It put Samsung\\'s Galaxy S series on the map, setting it up to be the iPhone\\'s main competitor for years to come.  And other Android phone makers simply couldn\\'t keep up, despite being more innovative in some ways. For example, tech critics praised HTC in 2013 for its eye-catching One M7 phone, which outpaced every Android phone on the market in terms of build quality and design. But it never had the sales to match those accolades, and HTC sold a chunk of its smartphone business to Google in 2018.  Motorola\\'s original Moto X from 2013 was also ahead of its time with hands-free voice controls that preceded the Amazon Echo and was well-received by reviewers. But Google sold off Motorola\\'s mobile unit to Lenovo 2014, and the PC giant has struggled to boost its presence in the smartphone market.  Even Google, which operates Android, has had a hard time breaking into the smartphone business. It pivoted to selling less-expensive Pixel smartphones after it had trouble selling high-end phones designed to compete with the iPhone and Samsung\\'s Galaxy S line.  LG took a similar path. It was ahead of competitors in some ways, such as its decision to bring cameras with a wider field of view to its smartphones years before Apple and Samsung did. But its smartphone division incurred losses totaling $4.5 billion over six years, which resulted in the decision to shut down the unit after Bloomberg reported the electronics maker failed to find a buyer. LG will instead focus on areas like smart-home devices, electric-vehicle components, robotics, and artificial intelligence.  Of course, the success of Samsung and Apple is just one element that\\'s influenced the market for mobile phones, albeit a big one. Popular Chinese brands that have stood out for their more accessible price points, like Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, and OnePlus, also rose in popularity about the time LG\\'s market share began slipping around 2015, Gartner data provided to Insider indicated.  Still, Samsung and Apple have been comfortably at the top of the smartphone market for years, and LG is just the latest casualty.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Apple in November started releasing Macs with Apple-designed M1 chips, and the Apple silicon technology will eventually replace all the Intel chips that Apple has used in its Mac lineup for years.    Intel appears to be having a difficult time with Apple\\'s transition. Last week, the company launched an anti-M1 Mac ad campaign starring Justin Long, and now, Intel is pinning its hopes on manufacturing Apple silicon chips for Apple in the future.  Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger today shared some details on Intel\\'s future plans, which includes the founding of a separate \"Intel Foundry Services\" business and two new chip factories that are being built in Arizona. Going forward, Intel wants to become a major provider of foundry capacity in the United States and Europe, manufacturing chips for other companies.  It\\'s really funny to hear Pat Gelsinger at #IntelUnleashed name drop potential collaboration with Apple on the new foundry business after Intel spent the last week on an ill-advised ad campaign dunking on Apple.  I don\\'t think the bridge is burned, it\\'s just eyebrow-raising. — James Sanders (@jas_np) March 23, 2021  When discussing Intel\\'s new plans, Gelsinger said that Intel plans to pursue Apple as a potential customer, which would see Intel producing Apple silicon chips for use in Apple devices if Apple does indeed decide to use Intel\\'s services.  Gelsinger just said that Intel, which is ramping up a foundry business to manufacture chips for other companies based on their designs, will court Apple as a customer. The age of the Intel Mac might not be over just yet. — Harry McCracken (@harrymccracken) March 23, 2021  IFS will be differentiated from other foundry offerings with a combination of leading-edge process technology and packaging, committed capacity in the U.S. and Europe, and a world-class IP portfolio for customers, including x86 cores as well as ARM and RISC-V ecosystem IPs.  Right now, Apple relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to produce all of the A-series and Apple silicon chips used in the iPhone iPad , Mac, and other devices. TSMC is Apple\\'s sole supplier, so there\\'s a chance that Apple and Intel could reach a deal that would allow Apple to diversify its supply chain.  If Intel wants to court Apple for future chip orders, the anti-Apple ads the company is running now may be unwise. Intel hired former \"I\\'m a Mac\" actor Justin Long to create a series of ads that compare the \\u200cM1\\u200c Macs with Intel PCs in a way that positions Intel PCs as superior machines.    Intel\\'s ads promote the flexibility of PC laptops and claim that no one uses Macs for gaming. The ads also make fun of the limited ports on Apple\\'s Macs and call them out for a lack of touchscreens. Intel has been highlighting its anti-M1 content on Twitter and has even made a heavily biased website that pits PCs against \\u200cM1\\u200c Macs.'},\n",

BuzzBGone Zap Review: Is this Buzz B Gone Zapper worth my money? By Apex Reviews Buzz B Gone Zap Reviews - Feature and Specifications, Pros and Cons, Customer Reviews and Pricing. Everything you need to know. New York, NY, April 12, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Summer has arrived, as we all know. For some of us, this means enjoyable days at the pool, barbeques in the backyard, and exciting nights of drinking and partying with our families. However, as the temperature rises, an unwelcome intruder in the home and outdoors emerges mosquitoes. When it comes to humans, mosquitoes are the most dangerous creatures on the planet. Mosquitoes are the only organisms that can cause us so much sickness and pain! They can spread a variety of dangerous diseases that many people are unaware of: the West Nile Virus makes you feel like you\\'ve got the flu. The Zika virus causes symptoms such as fever, rash, joint pain, and pinkeye, among others. It\\'s also dangerous for pregnant women because it can cause birth defects! Encephalitis causes brain and spinal cord swelling and is extremely harmful! Mosquitoes pose a lot of needless threats to us. So, if you or someone you know suffers from Skeeter syndrome, you know how important it is for us to be vigilant about mosquito bites. Believe me when I say that you don\\'t want to contract any of the diseases that mosquitoes will spread this summer! It is for this reason that the Buzz B-Gone Zap was introduced. It is a next-generation mosquito zapper that effectively and naturally destroys mosquitos without the use of harmful chemicals. It\\'s easy to set up and can be used wherever mosquitos are a concern, and thus, it has been referred to as a \"summer saver.\" This BuzzBGone Zap review will tell you everything you need to know about this mosquito zapper, including its features, benefits, drawbacks, customer feedback, and other information. What is Buzz B Gone Zap? It is on record that mosquitoes bite people with Skeeter syndrome. The bites swell, become inflamed, and painful. Every now and then, these people get a fever. They\\'re frequently depressing, and I don\\'t think I need to tell you how heartbreaking it is to see someone you care about get sick from mosquito bites on a regular basis. The Buzz-B-Gone is an insect-killing machine that uses an electric coil to zap mosquitoes and other bugs. Mosquitos fly into the purple light and are electrocuted by the coils. It is a bug zapper that can be hanging or set upright. Simply charge the battery with the provided micro USB cable, and you\\'re ready to zap bugs and mosquitoes anywhere! This Buzz BGone Zap is merely an improvement on the original\\'s design.

Why Should You Get Rid of Mosquitoes? Mosquitoes must be eliminated as easily and efficiently as possible, in my view. When it comes to mosquitoes, most people just understand what I refer to as \"surface-level\" problems, which include: ● Humming in the ears while resting, reading, or conversing with a mate. ● Bite marks that are itchy and swollen. Most people aren\\'t aware of the \"extreme\" problems that mosquitoes can cause. The numerous diseases that can be contracted from a mosquito bite, ranging from mild to fatal, are the most serious of these concerns. These illnesses include the following: ● Malaria ● Zika Virus ● Yellow ● West Nile Virus This may appear to be a scare tactic, but it isn\\'t. I believe it is in your best interests to be aware of the potential harm that those tiny little devils can cause. There\\'s a lot more to it than just humming in your ear. If you have a mosquito problem in your home, it is imperative that you find a fast solution. Why Would You Use Buzz B-Gone Zap Mosquito Killer? There are a number of reasons to use a bug zapper like this one. To begin with, killing mosquitoes is often a good idea for a variety of reasons. Mosquitoes are harmful insects that irritate our skin, cause pain, and spread serious diseases. Since mosquito bites can be so dangerous, even the World Health Organization recommends keeping a mosquito-free zone. Apart from some general reasons, this Buzz B-Gone Zap has its own set of benefits. To begin with, it is free of the harmful chemicals used in typical sprays. It also doesn\\'t need a zapper, is fully sterile, contains no toxins, and can be kept in your bedroom to keep you healthy while you sleep. If you\\'ve ever woken up with mosquito bites, you know that the little bloodsuckers will infiltrate any house, even if you\\'re trying to escape the summer heat by refusing to open the windows. And, when you think about it, Buzz B-Gone Zap\\'s mode of operation is entirely good and effective. It emits UV light that attracts bugs, which you already know works because bug zappers have been around for a long time. A fan inside the unit draws the bugs in when they get close enough. The bugs are doomed because they can\\'t get out once they\\'re inside. After all, by keeping it plugged in for a few nights and testing the insect cell in the mornings, you can put it to the test. The number of mosquitoes trapped inside would increase. Finally, you\\'ll be able to spend the whole summer without having to deal with mosquito bites and itching on a regular basis. If you are unhappy with the device, you can return it for a full refund. The device comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee. Who Stands To Gain From Buzz B-Gone Zapper? Someone who is continuously attacked by mosquitos will benefit from this innovative insecticide. Consumers in tropical areas of the world could be more susceptible to disease-carrying flying mosquitos. On the other hand, mosquito bites and noises will affect anyone. As a result, everyone is expected to have a Buzz B-Gone Zap. This device is appropriate for people of all ages and can be used by anyone. If you\\'ve missed summer camping due to mosquitoes, are tired of missing dinner parties due to mosquito bites, or can\\'t just have a nice family dinner in your backyard due to mosquitoes, this strong Buzz B-Gone Mosquito Trap Zapper gadget is for you. However, this device is not ideal for large buildings such as churches, restaurants, or other places where the capacity is exceeded. In such situations, the bulky bug zapper will be needed. Bug zappers, on the other hand, are often expensive. Small spaces, such as bedrooms or backyards, are ideal for Buzz B-Gone. BuzzBGone will give you peace of mind if your home is a bug/mosquito retreat center. Your surroundings are a huge source of bugs. Bugs are often a major problem for campers and hikers who want to enjoy the outdoors. Allergies are a hassle to handle. There will be no more untimely sneezes, coughs, or itchy bare skin with a Buzz B-Gone mosquito-killing kit. It\\'s also a money saver. It\\'s a home-based gadget that may not function in a larger environment, particularly if there\\'s a lot of foot traffic. If you are visiting a mosquito-infested place, bring your device with you to ensure a comfortable stay. What\\'s the Best Way to Use the BuzzBGone Zap? This device is incredibly simple to operate. It is ready to use right out of the box to kill mosquitos. Simply charge the device and position it in an environment where there are a lot of airborne bugs/mosquitoes. The device would then go to work, trapping mosquitos within the reservoir and killing them. ● Step 1: Use the provided micro USB cable to charge the Buzz B-Gone Zap. The LED indicator turns red when the battery is charging and orange when it is fully charged. ● Step 2: Turn the top rotary switch to turn on the device. After you hear a \"click,\" the purple LEDs will turn on. ● Step 3: For best results, place the Buzz B-Gone Zap in the desired location and leave it running for at least 2 hours. Mosquitoes and other flying insects would not be able to infest the region as a result of this. It is advisable that cleaning this device should be done on a regular basis. How Does The Buzz B Gone Zap Work? BuzzBGone Zap uses purple LEDs to lure mosquitoes and other bugs, then kills them with an electric coil. To attract and capture bugs, BuzzBGone uses a UV light and a suction fan. Mosquitos and other flying insects are naturally drawn to UV light, but the device\\'s powerful fan sucks them in, killing them. The combination of these two technical components aids in the development of this efficient buzzing insect killer. Yes, absolutely! Hundreds of mosquitos are drawn to the UV light, and the suction fan is both quiet and powerful. BuzzBGone\\'s proprietary design can destroy a persistent flood of mosquitoes due to the combination of these two technological features. With the use of this product, the user\\'s flying insect problem should be resolved easily. Buzz B-Gone is a cylindrical flying bug trap, control, and kill device that emits a 360° UV light, as previously mentioned. This light draws insects from the surrounding area, similar to bug zappers. In research, UV light has been shown to attract flying insects like mosquitoes, flies, gnats, and more. However, it does not zap the bugs as they approach. Instead, a powerful 360-degree fan pulls them in and transports them to the holding room, a trap from which they cannot run. Any bug that comes close to the light, which attracts nearly every irritating bug, becomes trapped within the BuzzBGone device. Mosquitoes, like humans, are water-dependent. In contrast, Buzz B-Gone is completely devoid of water. Instead, it has a dehydrator, which speeds up the dehydration process and allows the bugs it catches to die quickly. Simply plug the system into any available outlet to use it. The Buzz B Gone is then amazingly easy to activate and use. This is all that is needed to develop its capabilities and eradicate bugs permanently. Where Would You Buy BuzzBGone Zap? Simply go to the manufacturer\\'s website and place your order. Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, and American Express are all accepted as payment methods by the manufacturer. Customers\\' data is protected by 256-bit SSL encryption on the website.

Los Angeles, CA.) \"As soon as I read the testimonials, I realized Buzz B-Gone was the real deal. It utilizes the same equipment as the thousands-of-dollar commercial bug zappers used on restaurant patios. I built one in each of our bedrooms because we sleep with the windows open. If we\\'re getting a barbeque, I even take one outside. It repels ALL mosquitos and attracts flies and other bothersome insects as well!\" (Louise D. Portland, OR) \"My dogs like evenings on the deck, but the bugs feast on them, and they dislike it!\" I took my Buzz B-Gone Zap with me, and it worked well. There will be no more mosquitoes, and the puppies will be able to relax in peace.\" (Brooke King – Detroit, MI) \"I\\'m reclaiming my season.\" I understand that mosquito bites are unpleasant. Yet, they were much worse for me. The bites cause an allergic reaction, and the itching and swelling are intolerable. I tried some salves and lotions, but they were much more painful to my skin than mosquito bites! It\\'s a good thing Buzz B-Gone exists! It allows me to enjoy the evening outside rather than being cooped up inside like a prisoner.\" (Alan H. - Baltimore, MD) \"Last spring was extremely wet, with plenty of sunshine. Mosquitoes were in full effect, making time on the patio even less fun.

       "  'text': 'For the past three years, Apple had been reducing capital spending sharply – until last quarter. Could the increased cash outflow indicate ramped up production, or maybe something new to come?  When analysts comb through Apple’s financial results, most of the focus tends to be directed to the standard P&L line items: revenues, margins, earnings. In some cases, debt and cash balances also receive some attention.  There is one piece of the cash flow statement, however, that rarely ends up being discussed. The Apple Maven has observed that capex, officially known as “payments for acquisition of property, plant and equipment” (or PP&E), skyrocketed last quarter.  What could be behind the recent spike in Apple’s capital spending?  Capex: what is it?  First, let’s define capital expense. Capex is a cash disbursement made to acquire property, which in turn gets depreciated or amortized over time. Property, in this case, can be tangible (buildings, machinery) or intangible (software for internal use).  Apple does not break down the types of capital investments that it makes each quarter. However, we know that, as of fiscal first quarter 2021, about three-fourths of the company’s PP&E at book value consisted of machinery, equipment, and software. The rest was land, buildings, and improvements.  The surge in Apple’s capex  The graph below shows that Apple spent about $3.5 billion in capex in the last quarter alone. This is the most that the company has invested in property in a single three-month period since 2018. Also notice that the spike broke a three-year long downward trend.  To put this number in perspective, Apple currently holds a net cash balance of about $84 billion (including cash equivalents, excluding debt). At last quarter’s run rate, Apple has been spending nearly one-fifth of its net cash pile in capital projects per year.  One can only speculate what may be happening behind the scenes. One hypothesis is that capital investments during the pandemic year took a back seat to cash preservation. Now, the project backlog is finally moving again. COVID-19 does not explain, however, why capex had been declining since 2018.  Another possibility is increased production capacity to accommodate the newly launched Mac devices with internally developed M1 chip. As a reminder, Apple has announced that it would no longer equip its 13-inch MacBook Air and Pro with Intel hardware. The ARM-based architecture will likely be rolled out to Apple’s other laptop and desktop models as well.  Something big ahead?  Then, there is the possibility that Apple might be getting ready for something big ahead. According to Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi, Apple “has historically invested in gear, effectively financing third-party operations in exchange for secure production capacity for hardware components”.  Could the Cupertino company be ramping up production capacity for its existing products – or, even more intriguing, for something new altogether? Or will this jump in capex prove to be just noise in an otherwise declining trend in Apple’s capital investments?  It is hard to tell for sure, but one thing is certain: I will pay closer attention to this under-the-radar cash flow line when Apple reports fiscal second quarter results, late in April.

The New York Times named it one of the 10 best books of 2017.  According to Variety, Apple has secured the rights to develop Min Jin Lee’s novel into a series. A later report in The Hollywood Reporter stated that Apple has moved from simply optioning the novel to ordering a full eight episodes. It’s not clear if it’s a single season of a multi-season arc, or just an eight-episode miniseries.  Important names: It will be written and directed by Soo Hugh, who was the showrunner for the first season of AMC’s The Terror. Min-Ho Lee (Boys Over Flowers) and Jin Ha (Devs) will star.  When you can watch: No release date yet.  Time Bandits  What it’s about: Terry Gilliam’s time-traveling adventure comedy Time Bandits may make its way to the small screen in a TV series. Deadline reports that Apple is buying up the rights to make a TV show of the cult classic film.  The film, about a young boy who gets caught up with a troupe of thieves as they hop across history to steal treasure, ever on the run from the “supreme being” from whom they’ve stolen their time map, is good fodder for a TV show. But the film has a dedicated cult following who will place high demands on maintaining the film’s heart and quirky sense of British humor.  Important names: Terry Gilliam will have an executive producer role, but will not write for the show. A report in Variety says that the series will be directed by Taika Waititi, whose quirky film What We Do in the Shadows earned him a cult following, and who earned huge international acclaim for his direction of Thor: Rangrarok and Jojo Rabbit.  When you can watch: No release date yet.  Shantaram  What it’s about: The hit novel Shantaram has a somewhat tumultuous history in Hollywood. According to Variety, the book was first to be developed as a film, with Johnny Depp having acquired the book rights and Warner Bros. producing with Joel Edgerton in the starring role. Then, the plans were scrapped and the rights auctioned off, with Anonymous Content and Paramount Television winning the rights to Shantaram and its sequel novel The Mountain Shadow.  Gregory David Roberts’ novel tells the story of Lin, an escaped convict from a maximum security Australian prison. On the run and cut off from friends and family, he disappears into the Bombay underground in India.  Important names: Eric Warren Singer (American Hustle, The International) will write and executive produce the series. According to a report from Variety, the lead character will be payed by Charlie Hunnam, who is known for his work on Sons of Anarchy and for starring in Pacific Rim.  When you can watch: No release date yet.  You Think It, I’ll Say It  What it’s about: According to Variety, Apple has ordered a 10-episode, half-hour run of a new comedy variety show. The show is inspired by Curtis Sittenfeld’s collection of short stories You Think It, I’ll Say It.  Important names: SNL alum Kristen Wiig was set to star, but pulled out citing scheduling conflicts with Wonder Woman 1984. The show is created and produced by Colleen McGuinness (30 Rock, About a Boy).  When you can watch: This project does not yet have a title or release date.  Damien Chazelle drama series  What it’s about: According to Variety, Apple has gone straight-to-series (ordered a whole season of a series without first shooting a pilot) on a drama by Damien Chazelle. Chazelle is the acclaimed writer and director of La La Land and Whiplash, and is currently working on a Neil Armstrong biopic called First Man.  No details have been given about the series at all, except that Chazelle will write and direct every episode. We don’t know the subject matter, the stars, the length of each episode…really nothing at all.  Important names: Chazelle is the acclaimed writer and director of La La Land and Whiplash, and is currently working on a Neil Armstrong biopic called First Man.  When you can watch: No release date yet.  Untitled Sexual Assault Documentary  What it’s about: This documentary film follows a former music executive who is debating whether publicly tell her story of assault and abuse by a notable figure in the industry.  Important names: The film was executive produced by Oprah Winfrey, with Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering (The Hunting Ground) directing and producing.  Update 01/13/20: Oprah Winfrey has stepped away from the project, issuing the following statement:  First and foremost, I want it to be known that I unequivocally believe and support the women. Their stories deserve to be told and heard. In my opinion, there is more work to be done on the film to illuminate the full scope of what the victims endured, and it has become clear that the filmmakers and I are not aligned in that creative vision. Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering are talented filmmakers. I have great respect for their mission but given the filmmakers’ desire to premiere the film at the Sundance Film Festival before I believe it is complete, I feel it’s best to step aside. I will be working with Time’s Up to support the victims and those impacted by abuse and sexual harassment.  When you can watch: As a result of Oprah leaving the project, it will no longer appear on Apple TV+.\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'Apple stock traded lower yet again on March 30, and shares have been stuck near $120 for a while. The Apple Maven reviews the bearish forces pushing Apple lower on Tuesday.  Apple stock struggled to gain any lift on Tuesday, March 30. Shares finished the day down -1.2%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 ended the trading session lower -0.3%.  The dip put shares of the Cupertino company further into correction territory. Now, Apple is down nearly 10% for the year so far, and 16% below the late January all-time high.  This time, unlike in recent days, a couple of company- and industry-specific issues seem to have driven stock price action the most, rather than macro-level forces.  Wall Street Sign, aftermarket action on March 30 The Street  The Foxconn challenges  Taiwanese-based chip maker Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, more commonly known as Foxconn, provided a business update that was equal parts bitter and sweet for Apple. Keep in mind that this is the Cupertino company\\'s key parts supplier.  On the one hand, the Asian company announced that next-quarter sales will likely be better than normal, a result of work-from-home trends driving demand for tech devices. This is good news for Apple and its peers.  However, the market seemed more interested in Foxconn\\'s disclosure of potential materials shortage in the consumer electronics supply chain lasting through 2022. This could be a problem for Apple, amid the early innings of the 5G supercycle.  To be fair, I initially thought that the market\\'s bearish reaction to the news had been a little overdone. Foxconn itself qualified its supply shortage warning, saying that the issue could impact less than 10% of client orders.  Also, history has taught us that lack of proper product availability, when temporary, only delays Apple\\'s sales, merely shifting demand from one period to the next. This was the case, for example, between fiscal fourth quarter 2020 and the holiday season.  Epic battle and others  Apple stock\\'s struggles did not end with Foxconn. Epic Games submitted an antitrust complaint to UK authorities. This is yet another chapter in the \"epic battle\" between Apple and much of the tech world over App Store commissions.  In my opinion, Apple investors should get used to and comfortable with antitrust scrutiny from companies and governments around the world. It is unclear, at this point, whether the litigious nature of this matter will be a drag to Apple stock in the longer term. I even asked Twitter for its opinion, a few days ago:  Also worth mentioning, yields continued to climb this Tuesday. The interest rate on the 10-year note made its first intraday move past 1.75% since the start of the COVID-19 crisis. Keep in mind that rising yields tends to be bad for growth stocks, like Apple.  Lastly, although probably much less of a market mover, Apple has already scheduled its WWDC 2021 – the company\\'s five-day long developers\\' conference. The event will take place between June 7 and June 11, and the Apple Maven will cover it via live blog.  Last year, WWDC ended up being a big deal for the company and its investors, since Apple announced the M1 chip that now powers a few of its personal computers.

       "  'text': 'Mosyle has introduced a new MDM solution and launched a free service that may be of use to some of the growing number of enterprises deploying Apple devices across their business.  Apple ecosystem eyes enterprise opportunity  With 23% of US enterprises moving from PCs to Macs — and more than 55% of businesses using or approving use of Apple’s platforms across their business — these kinds of solutions are on a roll.  Founded in 2012, Mosyle began in the education market and later pivoted toward the enterprise. Its new solutions enter what seems to be a burgeoning market, dominated by Jamf and likely to see Apple’s own in-house solutions improve following the company’s purchase of Fleetsmith.  “Apple products set the standard for productivity, security and user experience. Because of that, the company has seen explosive growth in the enterprise market,” said Alcyr Araujo, Mosyle\\'s founder and CEO. \"But this comes at a time where work-from-anywhere initiatives are pushing management and protection away from the network to the endpoint.”  What is Mosyle Fuse?  Mosyle Fuse is a cloud-native mobile device management (MDM), security, and provisioning tool for Mac, iOS, and tvOS. Admins can automate Apple device management and provide single sign-on support for deployment with it.  Fuse supports user enrollment and offers integrations with Google, Microsoft, Active Directory, and APIs. It also includes automated antivirus installation and scanning.  The company says it leverages the latest Mac security tools to help users meet industry compliance mandates. The latter extends to compliance remediation and one-click audit reports.  Mosyle Fuse will automatically install, patch, and manage non-App Store apps, which should benefit enterprises that use unique solutions for their business.  In use, IT admins get clear dashboard warnings, including detailed information regarding compliance across the fleet. This clear UI also extends to third-party apps, so installation of Firefox, Teams, Chrome, and other popular applications can be managed effectively via the clean interface.  A free MDM service for SMBs  Mosyle is a relatively new company in this space, but it seems ambitious. It currently manages devices for 20,000 customers in more than 90 countries.  It likely hopes to build its market with the introduction of Mosyle Business FREE. This includes all the MDM features of the company’s premium business solution for up to 30 devices.  Mosyle points out that when it did something similar in its core education market, it reached thousands of schools who took advantage of the offer to support their own Apple deployments.  When I spoke with Araujo recently, he was quite clear concerning his ambitions.  “By combining a cloud-native architecture with a focus on usability, automation, and the best support on the market, Mosyle’s vision is to become the global leader for Apple MDM and endpoint security, redefining the standards created by legacy providers,” he said.  The importance of remote work and zero touch  Everyone I speak with in the MDM space agrees that these solutions must deliver effective support for remote working deployments in the form of zero-touch provisioning. The essential idea is that it should be possible for an employee to receive a new Mac or other Apple product, enter their account ID and login, and have devices be automatically configured with everything needed to get work done.  “Smart companies will focus on leveraging automated Apple MDM and endpoint security solutions to allow IT teams to ship new devices to employees,” Araujo said.  “Next-generation offerings will help IT teams ensure that from the initial configuration to software deployment and security, employees will benefit from the power and ease of use of Apple devices while ensuring the backend of the devices are always operating in compliance.”  Please follow me on Twitter, or join me in the AppleHolic’s bar & grill and Apple Discussions groups on MeWe.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'TipRanks  The investing game is rarely plain sailing. While no doubt investors would like the choices that make up their portfolio to always go up, the reality is more complicated. There are periods when even shares of the world’s most successful companies have been on a downward trajectory for one reason or another. While it’s no fun watching a stock you own drift to the bottom, any savvy investor knows that if the company’s fundamentals are sound to begin with, the pullback is often a gift in disguise. This is where the chance for strong returns really comes into play. “Buy the Dip” is not a cliché without reason. With this in mind, we scoured the TipRanks database and picked out 3 names which have been heading south recently, specifically ones pinpointed by those in the know as representing a buying opportunity. What’s more, all 3 are rated Strong Buys by the analyst consensus and projected to rake in at least 70% of gains over the next 12 months. Here are the details. Flexion Therapeutics (FLXN) Let’s first take a look at Flexion, a pharma company specializing in the development and commercialization of therapies for the treatment of musculoskeletal pain. The company has two drugs currently in early-stage clinical trials but one which has already been approved by the FDA; Zilretta is an extended-release corticosteroid for the management of osteoarthritis knee pain. The drug was granted regulatory approval in 2017, and Flexion owns the exclusive worldwide rights. FLXN stock has found 2021 hard going and is down by 30% year-to-date. However, the “recent weakness,” says Northland analyst Carl Byrnes has created a “unique buying opportunity.” Like many biopharmas, Flexion’s marketing efforts took a hit during the height of the pandemic last year, as shutdowns and restrictions impacted its operations. However, Byrnes anticipates Zilretta to exhibit “stellar growth in 2021 and beyond.” “We remain highly confident that the demand for ZILRETTA will continue to strengthen, bolstered by product awareness and positive clinical experiences of both patients and HCP, augmented by improvements in HCP interactions and deferral of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgical procedures,” the analyst said. Byrnes expects Zilretta’s 2021 sales to surge by 45% year-over-year to $125 million, and then increase by a further 50% to $187.5 million the following year. That revenue growth will go hand in hand with massive share appreciation; Byrne’s price target is $35, suggesting upside of ~339% over the next 12 months. Needless to say Byrne’s rating is an Outperform (i.e. Buy). (To watch Byrnes’ track record, click here) Barring one lone Hold, all of Byrne’s colleagues agree. With 9 Buys, FLXN stock boasts a Strong Buy consensus rating. While not as optimistic as Byrne’s objective, the $20.22 average price target is still set to yield returns of an impressive 153% within the 12-month time frame. (See FLXN stock analysis on TipRanks) Protara Therapeutics (TARA) Staying in the pharma industry, next up we have Protara. Unlike Flexion, the cancer and rare disease-focused biotech has no therapies approved yet. However, the picture should soon become clear regarding the timing of a BLA (biologics license application) for TARA-002, the company’s investigational cell therapy for a rare pediatric indication - lymphatic malformations (LM). TARA-002 is based on the immunopotentiator OK-432, currently approved as Picibanil in Japan and Taiwan for the treatment of multiple cancer indications as well as LM. Currently, Protara is seeking to get the FDA’s acceptance that TARA-002 is comparable to OK-432. If everything goes according to plan, the company anticipates potential BLA filing in H2:2021 and potential approval in H1:2022. Protara shares have tumbled 40% year-to-date. That said, Guggenheim analyst Etzer Darout believes the stock is significantly undervalued. “We estimate risk-adjusted peak sales of ~$170M (75% PoS) in the US alone (biologics exclusivity to 2034-2035),” the 5-star analyst said. “The company has outlined a ‘no additional study scenario’ that estimates a US launch in 2022 and an ‘additional registration study’ scenario that estimates a 2023 launch and we see current levels as a buying opportunity ahead of regulatory clarity on LM.” Furthermore, Tara is expected to submit an IND (investigational new drug) for a Phase 1 trial for TARA-002 in 2H21 for the treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Darout notes 80% (~65K) of all newly diagnosed bladder cancer patients suffer from this specific condition including ~45% “that are high grade with high unmet need.” The company also owns IV Choline, a Phase 3-ready asset, for which the FDA has already granted both Orphan Drug Designation and Fast Track Designation for IFALD (intestinal failure-associated liver disease). Based on all of the above, Darout rates TARA a Buy and has a $48 price target for the shares. The implication for investors? Upside of a strong 225%. (To watch Darout’s track record, click here) Overall, with 3 recent Buy ratings under its belt, TARA gets a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus view. The stock is backed by an optimistic average price target, too; at $43.67, the shares are anticipated to appreciate by ~198% in the year ahead. (See TARA stock analysis on TipRanks) Green Thumb Industries (GTBIF) Last but not least is Green Thumb, a leading US cannabis MSO (multi state operator). This Chicago-based company is one of the stalwarts of the rising cannabis sector, boasting the second highest market-cap in the industry and exhibiting impressive growth over the last year. In 2020, revenue increased by 157% from 2019, to reach $556.6 million. That said, despite delivering another excellent quarterly statement in March, and being well-positioned to capitalize on additional states legalizing cannabis, the stock has pulled back recently after the company was hit by a damning Chicago Tribune article. According to Chicago Tribune, the company is being investigated by the fed over \"pay to play\" payments regarding the procurement of cannabis licenses in Illinois. Countering the claims, GTBIF management said the allegations are unfounded and that there is no factual evidence to support them. Furthermore, the company pointed out it has not even been contacted by the authorities regarding the matter. Who to believe, then? It’s an easy choice, according to Roth Capital’s Scott Fortune. “We believe these tenuous claims create an opportunity to own the best-in-class operator currently off 25% from recent highs,” the 5-atar analyst opined. “In our view, the GTI business and track record of execution is not at risk in terms of the seemingly baseless accusations. We will continue to monitor any new additional incremental evidence potentially surfacing but believe the allegations are unfounded. We believe the upside opportunity remains compelling at these levels.” Going by Fortune’s $45 price target, shares will be changing hands for a 70% premium a year from now. Fortune’s rating remains a Buy. (To watch Fortune’s track record, click here) The negative news has done little to dampen enthusiasm around this stock on Wall Street. The analyst consensus rates GTBIF a Strong Buy, based on a unanimous 12 Buys. The average price target, at $47.71, suggests an upside of 79% over the next 12 months.

       "  'text': 'Apple’s iPhone has already replaced your wallet, keys, and flight tickets. Now in Utah, it is beginning to replace your driving license in a new pilot project.  What is happening?  The state is working on a mobile driving license (mDL) using a combination of technologies including NFC and QR codes as digital proof of ID. Holders of the license will be able to choose what personal information is displayed when the QR code is read, or NFC terminal tapped. This can be used in any situation in which you might be expected to present your driving license, including restaurants and bars.  Bluetooth verification is expected in the future.  The license will be made available to a limited number of people for a pilot program in June. Utah isn’t unique, by the way. The UK Driving Vehicle License Authority apparently began developing its own digital driving license in 2017.  What about compliance?  The Utah license complies with an ISO mobile ID standard. It has also been developed within guidelines developed by the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators. It is being piloted within the GET Mobile ID app, which is available for iOS 12 or above. (For Android, GetMobile recommends Android 10 or later.)  There are some useful advantages. If you change your name, address, or license information the changes will automatically be pushed to your digital license — or should be.  The one obvious problem? If your iPhone runs out of power and you don’t have the paper version of your driving license with you, or your device is stolen, you\\'re going to need backup.  “Carrying your physical document as backup is always a good idea, especially while the number of business accepting mobile documents is growing,” the mobile ID group says.  GETID says this deployment resists tracking, protects privacy, and has security protections. To use the app, you must enter a PIN code, use FaceID, or a fingerprint. You can also remotely wipe your device.  Beyond driving licenses  Apple exec Eddy Cue told us that replacing passports was one of the company’s ambitions back in 2015. An Apple patent published in 2018 described a system to take and securely store ID information from the RFID chip on passports.  Since then, we’ve seen some movement across governments to weave identity into iPhones, culminating in the current press toward use of smartphones as “COVID-19 passports.\"  While not everyone is comfortable with the idea of this additional layer of ID, what’s interesting is how stakeholders are approaching the challenge. For example, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) is developing its own Apple-friendly COVID-19 passporting system.  Scheduled for partial introduction on Virgin Atlantic’s London-to-Barbados route this month, it will integrate vaccination and testing status and advice, and will also hold a secure digital version of a traveller’s passport on the device.  Up next  While all these systems will likely require voyagers continue to carry their conventional passports along with their digital ID, the momentum is hard to ignore.  It’s a journey in which the significance of the identification carried by mobile devices continues to increase. These devices, which have already replaced so many things — and dozens of items of office equipment — are slowly but surely replacing other forms of digital identity.  The fact that digital devices are becoming critical to digital identities should act as a red flag for security and privacy advocates.  When our smartphones carry more information about us than we keep in our offices and homes it becomes essential to protect the contents of these devices to prevent identity theft. This is going to require a great amount of regulatory and logistical work before it becomes as widely accepted as Apple Pay.  That\\'s why most iPhone users won’t be leaving their physical passport or driver\\'s license behind for the time being.

       "  'text': \"Inside the county jail in Upper Marlboro, Md., sat 26 people who would be appearing any minute for their bail bond hearing in court — the first step in determining their path through the criminal legal system. Over Zoom, the judge would decide whether they would be waiting for their trial from home or a jail cell.  Story continues below advertisement  Also joining the Zoom call on this Monday afternoon in February, from bedrooms and kitchen tables across the country, were six strangers who had volunteered to witness the proceedings: two high school seniors, a retired Spanish teacher, a longtime restaurant worker, a graduate student and award-winning singer Fiona Apple, who would later use her spotlight the day of the Grammys to talk about the team and their fight for transparency.  Advertisement  Called court watchers, these volunteers are participants in a nationwide grass-roots effort to hold the judges, police and prosecutors of America accountable. Although they have existed in dozens of cities across the nation for years, operating mostly independently, the strain of the pandemic pushed the disparate groups to band together.  Led by the founders of Court Watch PG — two formerly incarcerated Black women — the groups are now pushing for greater visibility of their work and greater transparency in the courtroom.  Story continues below advertisement  For the last year in Prince George’s County, that has played out on Zoom virtual hearings, where volunteers have watched every bond hearing, every day. They have tracked in a database the name of the defendant, whether they were released or set free and the judge who made the decision.  Advertisement  But unlike the lawyers on those calls, the court watchers have not been granted video access, which means they cannot see the judge for themselves.  So every day, as Johnson calls the clerk’s office, the court watchers log in to their group chat and wait for her to fill in the blanks.  Johnson, 54, trained them all, preaching that “injustice happens in empty courtrooms” and explaining that they call all defendants their “loved ones” because nobody should face their bond hearing alone. Their entire operation — from the language they use with each other to the accountability letters they write to officials — is about personalizing a life-altering process that can feel like a cold assembly line.  Story continues below advertisement  For the past year, the stakes for these hearings has intensified as Prince George’s County became the state’s coronavirus epicenter and the disease began infecting prisons and jails across the country. Jury trials were canceled, then restarted, then canceled again.  Inmates at the Prince George’s jail, many of whom have not yet been convicted of a crime, have spent 23 hours a day in their cells during periods of the pandemic, waiting for trials that have largely been delayed since the courts first shut down in March 2020. Through it all, the population at the jail has climbed back up to prepandemic numbers, fed by the churn of daily bond hearings.  Advertisement  Johnson has sat through thousands of these proceedings for both violent and low-level crimes over the past year. She has seen pregnant mothers held without bail and listened to the desperation in people’s voices as they pleaded for their loved ones to be freed.  Story continues below advertisement  Along the way, Johnson determined that the decision to jail someone or let them go was rarely just about the crime they had been accused of committing. It was also about the perspective of the judge.  Which is why, when the clerk’s voice popped onto the line and told her who would sit on the bench that day, Johnson’s heart sank.  She typed the name into the Court Watch group chat.  “Oh Lord,” an observer wrote back.  'She's my teacher'  Carmen Johnson had been released early from federal prison for just over a year when she discovered Court Watch PG in 2019 and the woman who founded it, Qiana Johnson.  Advertisement  The two, who are not related, quickly saw themselves in each other.  Story continues below advertisement  Carmen ran her own business and was politically well-connected through her work with the state’s NAACP before serving three years in prison for financial crimes she said she didn’t commit.  Qiana had been working for the Department of Veterans Affairs before she was arrested in 2015 in connection with a real estate scam. When she got out of prison three years later, she founded Life After Release, an organization by and for formerly incarcerated women trying to reenter the world.  She soon became a regular speaker at events for other formerly incarcerated women, which is where she met Carmen, another Black woman broken by prison and looking for ways to give back.  At the time, Maryland liberals were pushing statewide bail changes, and debates about cash bond — which disadvantages the poor — were playing out in the county’s election for state’s attorney. A coalition of community groups wanted to get a reform-minded prosecutor elected, and Qiana Johnson, who was working with them through a fellowship program, started informally sitting in on bond hearings to learn what was at stake.  Advertisement  Story continues below advertisement  When the election ended — and a reformist, Aisha Braveboy, won — so did the coalition’s court-watching. But to Qiana Johnson, the work was just starting. Next she wanted accountability.  So Life After Release absorbed the court-watching program, and she began dreaming of a system where dozens of observers would write report cards for judges, monitor prosecutors and amass a database on bond hearings.  Carmen Johnson, she thought, could help. Qiana could not offer Carmen a salary, only an avenue to heal.  “She trusted in me and I trusted in her,” Qiana Johnson said.  “Whatever she wanted me to do, I was just down with it,” Carmen Johnson said. “I’m years older than her, and she’s my teacher.”  Story continues below advertisement  In February 2020, Carmen Johnson started court-watching every day, and slowly she felt her pain transform into purpose.  Advertisement  Then in mid-March 2020, as the coronavirus began to spread, courts closed — temporarily shutting off public access to bond hearings.  “I was like, what are we going to do now?” Carmen Johnson remembers thinking.  With court proceedings slowed, the small group turned to the jail population in Prince George’s. They advocated for the release of those who were medically vulnerable or charged with nonviolent crimes. When the state’s attorney’s office launched Operation Safe Release, aimed at lowering the jail population, their group began comparing their private database with the arrests listed publicly to figure out who was still in custody and who had been let go.  Story continues below advertisement  They raised money to bail people out.  But when bond hearings resumed in May, spiking as crime in the county rose, the women realized they needed help.  Advertisement  “Judges don't give a d--- about us,” Qiana remembers telling Carmen. “When they are going to start to care is when we have people power behind us.”  So Court Watch PG joined forces with national advocacy groups. Civil Rights Corps filed an emergency federal class-action lawsuit claiming coronavirus conditions at the Prince George’s jail were unsafe, and Zealous helped design and launch a viral campaign called “Gasping for Justice.”  In it, celebrities — including Apple — recorded statements from inmates who described unsanitary cells, prolonged isolation and a lack of mental health resources.  “It is easier for judges and prosecutors to order people detained under inhumane conditions when no one is looking,” the campaign said.  It urged the public to take action by court-watching.  Within a week and a half, 175 people had signed up.  'We notice'  Qiana Johnson and Carmen Johnson watched as their small enterprise transformed into a community of people across the nation who cared as much as they did about the courts.  Advertisement  One recent college graduate — who learned of Court Watch PG after protesting all summer with Black Lives Matter D.C. — helped overhaul the group’s database to enable deeper analysis of patterns. A Virginia high school student, who began court-watching on virtual learning days, built the group a new website. A retired high school Spanish teacher became the go-to court watcher monitoring interpreters and attorneys who talk over them.  Students in Howard University’s Movement Lawyering Clinic started court-watching, too, and they eventually wrote a harsh public critique of bond hearings that spread throughout the legal community.  It is now fighting for permanent virtual access to bond hearings — arguing that flexibility increases participation and transparency.  Court Watch PG has sent 100 accountability letters to judges, the jail, prosecutors and police, flagging concerns about misconduct, cell conditions and lawyer communications.  They also send letters to the office of the public defender, which Keith Lotridge, the county’s top public defender, said he welcomes. With more eyes on the courts, he said, everyone seems to be working hard to fix what’s broken.  “Covid has exposed so many flaws in the system,” Lotridge said. “One of the few benefits has been the ability of more people to witness those flaws. Going forward we’re seeing that the more community participation we have, the more voice the community is having in the results.”  Now, 120 people have cycled through Court Watch’s weekly training, which on one morning in late January included Fiona Apple.  When Apple appeared, Carmen Googled the singer’s face to confirm what she was seeing, then walked away from her computer to scream into her hands.  “Hello Ms. Apple,” Johnson remembers saying after collecting herself. Apple, hoping to go unnoticed, warmly greeted her back.  The singer had never heard of Prince George’s County before helping with Gasping for Justice, but she has become one of the team’s most prolific court watchers, volunteering three times a week and helping lead a committee focused on maintaining virtual access.  “It feels like you’re actually doing something useful” she said. “I don’t know if there’s any other feeling in the world. I mean, love is great, but being useful is another kind of love.”  Court-watching, Apple said, has opened her eyes to her own privileged pass with the law.  In her mid-30s, her tour bus was pulled over in Texas and she was arrested for felony hash possession. She was out of jail after one day, because she had a good lawyer and the money to afford her $10,000 bail. From afar, a friend wrote letters advocating for Apple to every single judge on the bench in that courthouse.  It made her realize the value of having “loved ones” who are invested and watching.  “You can’t just throw them away and no one’s going to notice,” she said. “We notice.”  'Here we go'  Some days Carmen Johnson was relieved to report the name of the judge to the Court Watch group, but today was not one of those days.  “Infamous, is she?” Apple asked in the chat.  “She’s very harsh,” another court watcher wrote back.  By this Monday afternoon in February, the court watchers had collectively observed 2,500 bond hearings, and their judge of the day was one who the court watchers considered least likely to let people out of jail.  The judiciary has said in statements that it welcomes feedback from the community, but emphasized that judges rule on the facts and the law, listening to arguments from defense attorneys and prosecutors about criminal history, community safety and the severity of charges before making a decision in any one case.  From their homes across the country, the court watchers called into the bond hearing and wondered what those decisions would look like today.  An unidentified voice began to crackle.  “Here we go,” sounded the chat.  In the first case of the day, they listened as the judge let out a woman charged with trespassing while trying to get help at a hospital. The judge then ordered a mother of four charged with driving under the influence and a history of similar charges to remain detained on no bond but referred her to drug court for potential treatment.  In the chat, the court watchers were confused.  “If her driving is a danger, why not release with condition not to drink and drive?” one court watcher asked.  “Exactly,” another chimed in. “Even house arrest would mitigate that ‘danger.’”  Back on the phone, a new lawyer was speaking about his 27-year-old client who had been charged with assault after she pulled a knife during an argument with a male acquaintance. Nobody was hurt, the defense attorney said, she had no prior arrests, she was not a flight risk.  The attorney said she had suffered a miscarriage only days earlier and had to leave a prior court hearing because she was vomiting blood. The man from the altercation told the judge he was not afraid and wanted her released.  “They need to let her go home and take care of herself,” someone wrote in the chat, but in court the prosecutor was telling the judge she was “exceedingly reluctant.”  “The court does have to think about the safety of this victim, even if he is saying he wants her released,” said the judge, who ordered the woman held without bond which allowed the possibility of release after review from the Department of Corrections.  The defense attorney said the charge would probably be dropped and his client was worried she could lose her job waiting for officials to release her. The judge, citing details from police in charging documents, did not budge.  The case was eventually dismissed — after the woman sat in jail for two weeks.  More cases followed: a chef charged with negligent driving who was punched in the face by police, someone arrested for attempted murder who just turned 19 and requested juvenile detention, and a man who had been released on bond, then rearrested and jailed, because of a clerical error.  “I feel like every case today has had a red flag,” the graduate student wrote in the chat.  “I would hate to be a loved one on today’s docket,” Apple wrote back.  As the day wound down, the group noticed a troubling theme: In half of the cases, defense attorneys complained they weren’t able to communicate with their clients ahead of the hearing. Many requested pushing their cases to the next docket for more time to prepare.  “Do you mind terribly, I’m so sorry, to wait until tomorrow afternoon?” a public defender asked her client in court in the last hearing of the day.  The defendant — a man accused of second-degree assault — said he had tried and tried to call. He needed to get out to help his elderly mother, and waiting meant at least another day in jail. But he relented.  “I have no choice in the matter,” the defendant said.  With that, the day was done. The court watchers dropped off the courtroom conference line and logged into Zoom, where they would soon see the faces of the friends they had been chatting with all day. They started to talk about their major takeaways from the day — where 26 out of 30 defendants remained in jail.  Carmen interrupted with some news.  She had heard the jail had changed its policy to prohibit defense attorneys from calling their clients — instead directing the clients to call their attorneys. The public defenders had been inundated all at once.  “It was an issue all around,” she said.  She advised the group to add it to their list of concerns for that week’s batch of accountability letters to officials.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"OnePlus  At first glance it seems like the Apple Watch has a worthy competitor in the new OnePlus Watch. For starters, it has a sleek circular screen that looks more like a traditional wristwatch than the square Apple Watch. It also shares a lot of the same health features as the $400 Apple Watch Series 6 including SPO2 (or blood oxygen) tracking and high heart rate alerts but it costs $160. The OnePlus watch is even $40 cheaper than the entry-level Series 3 Apple Watch, which starts at $200.  But even with all these features and a cheaper price, the OnePlus Watch has one major shortcoming preventing it from competing in the same league as the Apple Watch. It's not yet compatible with the iPhone.  Read more: Apple Watch SE vs Series 6 vs. Series 3: How to choose?  Now playing: Watch this: The OnePlus Watch can't beat the Apple Watch  iOS compatibility: Worth the wait?  OnePlus says iOS compatibility is coming to the Watch in the future, but we don't know exactly how it will work. Apple does support pairing non-Apple wearables to the iPhone, but the experience is not the same as using the Apple Watch.  OnePlus  Fitbit, Samsung and the One Plus watches for example allow you to respond to notifications and take calls on Android, but iPhone users can't so much as send a thumbs up emoji from their wrist, let alone take a quick call, unless they own an Apple Watch. One of the main benefits of having a smartwatch is being able to quickly glance and respond to notifications on your wrist, otherwise you might as well wear a simple fitness band.  You may also be limited when it comes to other connectivity options like LTE. The Apple Watch has a version with built-in LTE so you can use your watch independently of the phone, while the OnePlus Watch only has a WiFi model.  Anecdotally, I've also found that non-Apple watches don't sync as fast when connected to iOS compared to the Apple Watch.  Specs compared  If you're willing to overlook the compatibility shortcomings on iOS in favor of the cheaper price tag and longer battery life there are other things to consider.  In terms of design, it's a matter of preference. Do you like square-ish or circular watchfaces? They both have AMOLED screens, but screen brightness is just as important and we haven't seen the OnePlus in action yet so can't say if it's as bright as the newest Apple Watch.  The other design factor is size. While the Apple Watch offers a 40 and 44 mm option, the OnePlus Watch only comes in a 46 mm watch face option with a black frame, which may overwhelm smaller wrists. Both have interchangeable watch bands.  Accuracy on health and fitness tracking is TBD  Both watches track pace, distance and heart rate with built-in GPS and water resistance, so you can use them to track swims. The OnePlus Watch offers over 100 different workout options compared to over 40 on the Apple Watch. There's even a parkour option which you won't find on the Apple Watch.  Health features seem similar. They both have high heart rate alerts, monitor blood oxygen levels and track sleep. The OnePlus also uses heart rate to track stress which the Apple Watch doesn't, but lacks an electrocardiogram like what you'll find on the top of the line Series 6.  But Apple has a good track record in validating its health and fitness features, including FDA-clearance for the ECG app. The OnePlus Watch is completely new to the space and will require testing and validation, both from reviewers and medical associations alike.  Music is lacking on the OnePlus Watch  If music is a must on your smartwatch, then the Apple Watch takes the crown. You can stream Apple Music or Spotify on the LTE version of the Apple Watch, or store songs from your own library for offline listening, with storage capacity varying on the version. If you want to listen to music on the OnePlus watch you'll have to preload it yourself. It has 2GB worth of storage which is good for about 500 songs.  Unbeatable battery life on the OnePlus Watch  OnePlus is the clear winner when it comes to battery life, claiming two weeks of runtime before needing a charge. Obviously this must also be taken with a grain of salt until we can run our own tests, but even if the OnePlus Watch delivers just half of what it promises, it's still miles ahead of any Apple Watch which lasts a day and a half at best. The Apple Watch also takes anywhere between 1.5 to 2 hours to reach a full charge, while OnePlus says its watch can get a full week of charge in 20 minutes.  Jury's still out  Even with iOS compatibility, the OnePlus Watch has a lot to prove. On paper it seems like a worthy Apple Watch rival, but we won't know how well it executes on all of its promises until we test it out for ourselves. In the meantime, the $200 Apple Watch Series 3 continues to be the best budget option for iPhone users.\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'By Cathy Salter  In 2014, when the world was in a different place, I flew with a longtime friend to Istanbul.  There is much about gardens that can be learned from a visit to Turkey. Why, one might ask, are tulips woven into a massive wool prayer rug in Istanbul’s Blue Mosque and so frequently depicted in handmade tiles sold in this historic city’s Grand Bazaar? What’s the source of the delicious quince marmalade served for breakfast at Istanbul’s elegant Pera Palace Hotel — built in 1892 for passengers arriving from Europe aboard the Orient Express Railway?  Searching for answers, I begin leafing through botanical volumes in my library. In \"The Gardener’s Atlas,\" I learned that Ogier Ghiselin dee Busbecq, ambassador from the Holy Roman Empire to the Ottoman Empire, noticed some fine flowers growing in Turkish gardens in Constantinople in the early spring of 1554. Among them were “those which the Turks call tulipam … admired for their beauty and variety of their colors.”  Busbecq sent bulbs to the famous French horticulturalist Carolus Clusius, Imperial Gardner in Vienna. Clusius then distributed bulbs to friends throughout Europe, marking the beginning of the Dutch tulip bulb industry. Dutch horticulturalists in Amsterdam supplied London and the world with tulips, daffodils and hyacinths, while Dutch artists portrayed tulips in masterworks of art.  That mystery solved, I’m now on the trail of quince — a fruit commonly grown in America in colonial times, but rarely found in contemporary backyard gardens. While in Istanbul, I was so taken with the delightful flavor of the fruit that I brought home a small jar of Quince (Ayva) Marmalade, produced by Soteks, Ltd, Türkiye. The label illustration is of a yellow, pear-shaped fruit and pinkish coral-colored blossoms.  Easter week, Kit and I spotted several well-established flowering quince bushes while driving Route A to Hartsburg — each filled with electric orange, camellia-shaped blossoms. By afternoon, Kit had purchased one as an Easter surprise. It is now planted at the edge of the orchard near a dwarf pear.  But what about quince trees, still common in rural America’s backyards in the late 19th century? Perusing the \"Encyclopedia of Cooking,\" I learn that this hard, dry-textured fruit of a tree belonging to the apple family is native to temperate regions of Asia (Turkey being one location). The fruit ripens in September when quinces become golden yellow and resemble apples or pears.  After an online search of Stark Bro’s Nursery in Louisiana, Missouri, an order is placed for a dwarf Orange Quince tree, a semi-dwarf Montmorency Pie Cherry tree and a Brown Turkey Fig tree. Established soon after James Hart Stark arrived from Kentucky in 1816 with apple scions from his family orchard, Stark Bro’s is still family-owned and has the largest online, direct-to-customer nursery in the country.  Anticipating their arrival, I pour through old cookbooks in search of quince recipes. In “The Shaker Cook Book”—from Pleasant Hill near Lexington, Kentucky—I find a recipe for Amelia’s Quince Pudding. A beautifully illustrated copy of “Crabtree & Evelyn Cookbook” suggests a light menu of tomato and celery soup, glazed pork loin with garlic potatoes, and brussels sprouts in brown butter, followed by apple-quince bread pudding for dessert.  Having traced the quince fruit back to its Asian origins, I check Claudia Rodin’s “The New Book of Middle Eastern Food” and find numerous contemporary recipes for this ancient fruit—Quince(s) with fish; poached in syrup; preserves; with roast duck; stuffed; with tangine of lamb; and in couscous with tomatoes and fish.  Finally, I pull out James Beard’s 1972 classic tome, “American Cookery,” and am delighted to read his take on this largely forgotten fruit, once common in America’s backyard gardens:  “Few people know the delicacy and flavor of cooked quince, and they are brilliant in bouquet both cooked and raw. When peeled, cut into sections and baked, they make a nice change from other fruit dishes. Cool the baked quince and serve with heavy cream or sour cream.”  What’s not to love about that old recipe?  Cathy Salter is a geographer and columnist who lives with her husband, Kit, in southern Boone County at a place they call Boomerang Creek.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Business  After a raucous start to the year, Wall Street expected non-professional traders to pump chunks of their $1,400 stimulus checks into the stock market, supporting popular names like Tesla and Apple. So far, that doesn’t appear to be happening.  Breaking it down: Retail investors who helped power GameStop mania haven’t been rushing to buy their favorite tech names, meme stocks or short-dated call options with the ferocity they exhibited in late January and early February. Daily net purchases of US equities by retail traders dipped in late March, just as stimulus checks were hitting bank accounts, data from Vanda Research’s VandaTrack shows.  Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said this is a major reason that the VIX, a measure of US stock market volatility, recently fell to its lowest level since February 2020.  “The drop in the VIX is in part due to less retail speculation and call buying,” Boockvar told me.  What’s caused these traders to take their foot off the pedal? As inflation fears ricocheted across markets, stocks that had exhibited lots of momentum, benefitting the retail crowd, started to reverse course. Apple dropped 8% in February, while Tesla shed more than 15% in February and March.  That spooked small investors, who are very sensitive to these changes, Vanda Research cofounder Eric Liu said. When the value of retail portfolios falls back, that often leads to changes in buying habits.  “There’s a clear relationship between how retail performs today and their proclivity to invest tomorrow,” Liu said.  He doesn’t expect retail to stay on the sidelines indefinitely, though there’s a sense now that investors are looking for their next obsession. Recently, there’s been significant investment in broad exchange-traded funds, which indicates there’s not a lot of conviction about the Next Big Thing, Liu added.  If Big Tech starts to consistently rally again, the calculus could change, and February’s fears may be cast aside. FAANG stocks — Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google — plus Microsoft make up about 28% of the typical retail portfolio, according to Vanda Research.  “If you get those big growth names outperforming again … then you see retail come back in again,” Liu said.  On the radar: This could happen before long. Apple, Amazon and Microsoft have already gained 9% in April, while Google parent Alphabet has added more than 10%. With earnings season coming up, strong results could help these stocks move higher, encouraging retail to rejoin the fold.  But they also remain exposed to concerns about higher prices once the economic recovery takes off — a trend that hurts fast-growing shares.  “If there’s one thing that upsets the apple cart, it’s a move higher with rates and inflation,” Boockvar said.  Alibaba will survive record fine, but it’s still a ‘warning shot’  Alibaba is trying to draw a line under accusations that it behaved like a monopoly after Chinese regulators hit the online shopping giant with a record fine over the weekend. But that doesn’t mean the crackdown on tech in China is over, my CNN Business colleague Laura He reports.  The latest: Joe Tsai, Alibaba Group’s co-founder and executive vice chairman, told investors on Monday that the company will not appeal the 18.2 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) penalty that China’s State Administration for Market Regulation imposed on the business.  Regulators had investigated Alibaba for “exclusive dealing agreements” that prevented merchants from selling products on rival e-commerce platforms.  The fine is equivalent to 4% of Alibaba’s sales in China in 2019, state news agency Xinhua reported, and dwarfs the previous record penalty of $975 million handed out to American chipmaker Qualcomm in 2015.  It could have been worse, and the outcome has removed a key source of uncertainty for Alibaba and its investors. Shares rallied 6.5% in Hong Kong on Monday, though the stock is still down more than 20% since last November, when regulators pulled affiliate Ant Group’s highly-anticipated public offering. The company’s stock in New York is up 6% in premarket trading.  But Wall Street shouldn’t get complacent.  The fine is a “warning shot across the bow for the entire big tech sector in China,” said Alex Capri, a research fellow at Hinrich Foundation and a visiting senior fellow at National University of Singapore.  Brock Silvers, managing director of Chinese private equity firm Kaiyuan Capital, said the incident is an example of how “opaque policy and private political maneuvering” can suddenly erase shareholder wealth.  “Regulators are now preparing to increase their battle against China’s corporate titans, which should be quite worrisome to global investors who may be increasingly exposed to China risks that have long been unseen and remain unquantifiable,” Silvers said.  Levi’s stock jumps as jeans make a comeback  Stock in Levi Strauss is soaring as people get ready to squeeze into their denim again.  The latest: Shares of the company, which went public in 2019, are at an all-time high after the company reported earnings last week, my CNN Business colleague Paul R. La Monica reports.  Overall sales were down due to store closures tied to the pandemic. But the company said digital sales soared more than 40%, and now account for more than a quarter of overall revenue.  Levi Strauss CEO Chip Bergh told analysts that a “denim resurgence” is boosting the entire casual clothing industry. It helps that for many, workwear is expected to stay relatively casual even after people return to the office.  “I feel much more confident today than I did even a month ago about our ability to come through this pandemic in a much stronger position,” Bergh said.  Investor insight: Levi’s stock has rallied 28% this year. Rival Kontoor Brands, which owns Wrangler and Lee, has jumped more than 40%.  Up next  Coming tomorrow: The US Consumer Price Index will shine a light on whether prices are increasing as the recovery gathers steam.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is working on a new privacy feature for iOS 14 called App Tracking Transparency. The feature will go live to everyone with the release of iOS 14.5 this spring.  Few companies have been more outspoken about the changes than Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). The company warned that \"the impact of platform changes, notably iOS 14\" will act as a \"significant ad targeting headwind\" during its fourth-quarter earnings release.  But CEO Mark Zuckerberg has started to accept the forthcoming changes from Apple. In fact, he recently said the new privacy feature could strengthen its position with businesses and advertisers.  What exactly is changing?  The new feature from Apple will block apps and websites from collecting and sharing an identifier called IDFA (The Identifier for Advertisers). This will prevent Facebook from using something called \"view-through conversions\" to get a complete picture of an ad\\'s effectiveness.  If a person sees an ad on Facebook but doesn\\'t immediately take action, that doesn\\'t mean the ad was completely ineffective. That same person may do a web search for that product later and buy it. But with Apple\\'s update, Facebook will never know that, and neither will its advertisers.  Today, when a person makes a purchase on a retail website or app, that retailer can share the IDFA with Facebook. Facebook can then check to see whether that same IDFA saw an ad for that product on Facebook or Instagram and show the effectiveness of its ads.  If Facebook can\\'t track conversions outside of its app, advertisers have no idea how valuable its ads really are. They\\'re left guessing, and some might not like the uncertainty compared to other digital advertising platforms that can more easily track conversions without input from other apps -- for example, Amazon.  Facebook says its Audience Network, which displays advertisements in third-party apps, will get hit hardest by the changes. It warned that developers using Facebook Audience Network could see revenue decline 50% after Apple announced the new feature. The Audience Network only accounts for a small percentage of Facebook\\'s ad business.  Facebook isn\\'t the only company that Apple could hurt with the update. Most digital advertising companies will face the same effect on their ability to measure advertising effectiveness on iOS. And Facebook\\'s size, reach, and existing user data may give it an advantage in taking share of the market in a post-iOS 14.5 world.  CFO Dave Wehner agrees, but he says the market could shrink in the new environment. \"Whereas we might be able to maintain or possibly improve our share of wallet ... I do think you\\'re just going to get advertisers and businesses who are going to decide that it\\'s not cost-effective to advertise [on iOS],\" he said during a follow-up call with analysts after management\\'s fourth-quarter earnings call.  Why Zuckerberg now thinks it\\'s an opportunity for Facebook  Zuckerberg seemed to have a change of heart during a discussion on Clubhouse on March 18. \"It\\'s possible that we may even be in a stronger position if Apple\\'s changes encourage more businesses to conduct commerce on our platforms,\" he said.  Looking back, native commerce tools on Facebook\\'s app seem to have been the tech company\\'s backup plan ever since last summer when Apple announced App Tracking Transparency.  Facebook meaningfully accelerated the rollout of e-commerce features across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger over the last nine months. While the COVID-19 pandemic has certainly played a role in Facebook\\'s urgency to offer new tools to small businesses, the forthcoming iOS changes likely played a role as well.  During Facebook\\'s fourth-quarter earnings call, Wehner mentioned: \"We hope to help businesses by providing more on-site conversion opportunities through initiatives like shops, and also click to messaging ads,\" when discussing ways to mitigate the effect of Apple\\'s new privacy settings.  With a growing suite of e-commerce products, Facebook may actually gain more share of business from small online retailers and those that don\\'t yet have much of an online presence. That could make them more reliant on Facebook ads to drive traffic and sales, and boost revenue for the social network. It could also benefit Facebook\\'s efforts to monetize WhatsApp and Messenger with more tools for businesses to connect with customers and complete sales through direct messaging.  Only time will tell how Apple\\'s iOS changes will affect Facebook and the rest of the digital advertising industry. But the FAANG stock is well-positioned to navigate the environment and use the changes to sell businesses on its e-commerce features.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Apple has a rocky relationship with some iOS developers because of its seemingly arbitrary decisions over what gets published and when — and now, because of a dumb miss, it’s being accused of putting profits ahead of human rights in Myanmar by the founder of ProtonMail and ProtonVPN, even though that’s probably not what happened.  Proton founder Andy Yen writes that Apple blocked an important security update to the company’s privacy-protecting ProtonVPN software simply because Apple didn’t like the app’s description, specifically this line:  Whether it is challenging governments, educating the public, or training journalists, we have a long history of helping bring online freedom to more people around the world.  If you’re having a hard time finding anything objectionable there, you’re not alone — but Apple told Proton it wasn’t okay to encourage “users to bypass geo-restrictions or content limitations.”  The context here is that VPNs have become a critical tool for protesters in Myanmar to sidestep an huge internet crackdown during the country’s ongoing, bloody military coup. One researcher told Bloomberg that VPN use has increased 7,200 percent since early last month, when the government blocked Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.  I’m with Daring Fireball’s John Gruber on this: I highly doubt Apple made a conscious decision to deny ProtonVPN to Myanmar — the company’s smart enough to know how that would look, and it’s not like the app was blocked, just a security update. Yen is an outspoken critic of the App Store now, having told Congress (and The Verge) last year how he’d been strong-armed by Apple.  But the fact it’s just a security update makes the rejection extra dumb, because Apple explicitly said last year that it’d no longer hold up bug fixes because of these arbitrary guideline violations.  Regardless, Apple comes off looking a little like the bad guy here, especially now that ProtonVPN has taken the high road and ceded to Apple’s demands. “Due to the emergency situation in Myanmar, we removed the language about challenging governments which Apple found objectionable, and the app was finally approved,” Yen tells The Verge. Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment.  That perception seems like it’s going to be increasingly hard to fight, now that antitrust scrutiny of Apple’s App Store has been heating up in Congress and the courts, with the Epic App Store trial set to begin May 3rd.  It doesn’t help when Apple is seemingly caught breaking its own rules and needing to apologize, particularly when it could be seen as retaliation against an app developer (Yen) who’d previously spoken out. Last year, many other developers weren’t willing to come forward and admit they’d been forced to add in-app purchases to their apps, specifically because they feared retaliation.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'The massive demand for iPhone 12s was reported in Apple\\'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) blowout first quarter, the tech giant\\'s first-ever $100 billion quarter.  With the iPhone 12 catapulted to the top of the 5G smartphone market within weeks of its launch, an analyst now says his channel checks show that the so-called \"supercycle\" continues unabated, and not even a chip shortage can slow it down.  Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives told investors in a research note that after checking into Apple channels, he discovered builds for the current quarter continue at a blistering rate -- between 56 million and 62 million -- without any letup in demand. Even the June quarter could see them in the mid 40 million range.  He says this is the greatest demand trajectory in years, possibly going as far back as 2014 when the iPhone 6 was released. As a result, Ives is keeping his outperform rating on the stock and a $175 per share price target. Factoring in Friday\\'s closing price at a penny under $120, this would mean Apple has 46% upside still possible.  There might be good reason for such bullishness. Samsung Securities analyst MS Hwang told Bloomberg last week the tight supply of semiconductor chips \"is affecting everybody except Apple.\"  Apple has been largely immune from the shortage because it designs its own chips and has them manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM). Android phones, however, are all competing for chips from the same suppliers, such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Samsung, and the latter\\'s Texas plant has been down since last month\\'s power outages, potentially causing a 5% drop in global smartphone supply.  Samsung is even considering skipping an update to its best-selling Galaxy Note this year because Qualcomm can\\'t keep up with the unrelenting demand for smartphones that use its Snapdragon chips.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Andrew Hoyle/CNET  It feels as though the iPhone 12 has just dropped, but already the rumor mill is in full swing over the iPhone 13 as Apple\\'s marquee event in the fall inches closer. As usual, a wide range of topics are under debate: Will we see a foldable iPhone? What about a smaller notch? And will Apple finally killing the Lightning port? Plenty of rumors are swirling around about the iPhone 13, so here we\\'re focusing on some of the most credible ones to help get a sense of what to expect from the next-gen iPhone.  For now, we\\'re expecting four models: the iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max. But to be fair, we can\\'t be certain the name iPhone 13 will wind up being used. Rumors suggest Apple may go with iPhone 12S instead, implying only a minor technical upgrade from the iPhone 12, which saw some bigger changes like the introduction of 5G and a design revamp. Apart from the expected incremental upgrades to things like processor and batteries, here\\'s what you can expect from the upcoming iPhone family. (For the purposes of this article, I\\'ll refer to it as the iPhone 13.)  Read more: iPhone 13 rumors so far: What we\\'re hearing about release date, specs, price and more  iPhone 13 probably won\\'t be a foldable  The iPhone 12 lineup saw a noteworthy makeover, so a major glow-up for the iPhone 13s is unlikely. If you\\'ve been holding out for a foldable iPhone, I\\'m afraid 2021 probably won\\'t be the year it hits shelves (if it ever does). Instead, we\\'re hearing of a similar \"slabular\" design with the iPhone 5\\'s flat sides and the same four sizes, starting with the smallest 5.4-inch iPhone Mini all the way to up the expansive 6.7-inch iPhone 12 Pro Max.  As far as design goes, I\\'m low-key hoping for a smaller notch or (even better) an entirely notchless screen. For the notch to go away, however, Apple first has to figure out how to put the Face ID camera modules under the screen. Based on some recent rumors, this is a design element that could make its way to the iPhone 13.  Lightning port? Looks like it\\'s here to stay (for now)  Noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo had once indicated in a report that Apple would kill the Lightning port, making way for a completely portless phone. Apple\\'s introduction of MagSafe to the iPhone 12 seemed to add weight to that claim.  Read more: iPhone 12\\'s Lightning port may be the next thing Apple kills  But Kuo is walking back on his portless iPhone assertion, for now at least. In a recent report, obtained by Apple Insider, he says MagSafe isn\\'t a mature enough ecosystem yet that Apple can solely rely on it for charging the iPhone 13. That means Apple will need to keep its lighting port since USB-C is unlikely to happen for the iPhone.  Andrew Hoyle/CNET  120Hz display likely  One feature that\\'s rumored to change in a noteworthy way is the screen. Kuo predicts the two iPhone 13 Pro models will use LTPO technology in their displays to give it a 120Hz refresh rate, which we\\'ve heard in earlier rumors too. This is a feature already present in Android phones like Samsung\\'s high-end Galaxy S21 series and even Xiaomi\\'s budget-friendly Redmi Note 10 Pro. Although Apple doesn\\'t disclose refresh rates, the iPhone 12 variants all have a 60Hz screen refresh rate, matching the iPhone 11 display.  Prices should stand still  As I mentioned earlier, don\\'t hold your breath for any revolutionary technical changes to the iPhone 13, which will likely feature incremental upgrades. Because of this, analysts expect iPhone 13 prices to come in at a similar range as the iPhone 12, which starts at $799 (£799, AU$1,349). Add to the mix that the iPhone 12 led to the largest revenue and profit quarter in Apple\\'s history, and it looks likely Apple will hit the repeat button when it comes to the pricing structure.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Angela Lang/CNET  Apple plans to call some of its highest profile executives to testify as part of its upcoming trial with Fortnite maker Epic Games. Apple said it plans to call its CEO, Tim Cook, software head Craig Federighi, and Apple fellow Phil Schiller, as well as employees who help combat fraud, manage payment processing and those who build developer tools for iPhone apps. Apple said it plans for all its witnesses to appear in person.  \"Our senior executives look forward to sharing with the court the very positive impact the App Store has had on innovation, economies across the world and the customer experience over the last 12 years,\" Apple said in a statement after filing its witness list late on Friday. \"We feel confident the case will prove that Epic purposefully breached its agreement solely to increase its revenues, which is what resulted in their removal from the App Store.\"  Epic didn\\'t immediately respond to a request for comment. The gaming giant plans to call its CEO, Tim Sweeney, as well as other executives to discuss the company\\'s business model, financial performance and the Epic Games Store. The company also plans to call Apple\\'s former head of iOS software, Scott Forstall, to discuss the differences between mobile devices and PCs and the history of App Store policies and practices.  Now playing: Watch this: Epic vs. Apple lawsuit heads to trial in 2021  Apple\\'s submission of its tentative witness list marks some of the final steps the companies are taking before their upcoming trial, due to begin May 3. The two massive companies -- one makes the iPhone; the other makes one of the most popular games in the world -- have been fighting in courts and in public over how app stores work on smartphones and who gets how much money when people buy items in games and other apps.  Boil it down and this looks like a corporate slap fight over who gets how much profit when gamers buy a new way for their Fortnite character to dance or a new look for one of their virtual weapons. But Epic sees it as a battle for independence, and Apple views it as a clash over the future of how app stores work.  Apple forces app developers to use its payment processing systems, and it charges a commission of up 30% on all those new character costumes you can buy in a game, something Epic\\'s Tim Sweeney says is unfair. In letters to Apple, and then in his company\\'s lawsuit against the iPhone maker, he\\'s argued that developers themselves should be able to choose their payment processors, circumventing Apple\\'s commission. Sweeney says extra money can be passed on to gamers as a price cut to customers, which he\\'s offered, or to developers to help fund their next big hit.  The battle boiled over in August last year, when Epic chose to turn on hidden code in its Fortnite mobile game on the iPhone and on devices powered by Google\\'s Android, allowing people to choose which payment processor they used, and thus get a discount if they chose Epic\\'s. Both Apple and Google swiftly removed Fortnite from their stores, and Epic responded with lawsuits that argued both companies were abusing their market power.  Epic isn\\'t the only one pressing Apple and Google over antitrust concerns. Legislators and regulators around the world have increasingly begun investigations or considered rules to rein in what they say are monopolistic practices by tech\\'s biggest companies, including Apple and Google. So far, they\\'ve done little, but the outcome of this lawsuit -- if it isn\\'t settled before a verdict is handed down -- could change the course of how governments approach making their cases.  The Epic-Apple proceedings are expected to begin May 3 before Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers.

       "  'text': \"Centralia, Pa. – The mostly abandoned coal mining town of Centralia will soon see new life when an environmental group plants 250 apple trees during an event on April 17.  Hosted by the Eastern Pennsylvania Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation (EPCAMR), the planting is part of a plan to restore the ecosystem in the town and improve wildlife habitats.  Robert “Bobby” Hughes, executive director of EPCAMR, said the group will be planting 16 varieties of trees next weekend in an effort to beautify the properties there that are vacant. The trees are expected to grow four to five feet high.  “The town isn’t completely abandoned. About seven families still live there,” Hughes said. He pointed out that there is a cemetery in Centralia as well as a church that people from surrounding areas still frequent.  This comes one year after the popular unofficial tourist attraction of Graffiti Highway was covered in dirt in an effort to keep people off the abandoned stretch of highway. The area saw an increase in visitors last spring during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Related Reading: Centralia's Graffiti Highway becomes a memory  An underground fire has been burning in Centralia for more than 50 years. The three-quarter mile stretch of Route 61 was closed in 1993 due to safety issues. Curious visitors started flocking to the area and leaving behind litter, which EPCAMR has been cleaning each year during an annual cleanup event.  The tree planting project is funded by a grant from ISI and Mental Insight Foundation. Heller Orchards, Brace’s Orchard, and Wafler Nursey are among organizations donating plants and supplies. The group will utilize innovative grow boxes from Holland to plants the trees, Hughes said.  EPCAMR has also partnered with Keystone 10 Million Trees Partnership, who are donating shelters for the trees as well as native trees for a fall planting to continue the legacy during the next annual cleanup in October 2021, according to the EPCAMR website.  Hughes said the group also is interested in planting plants that will attract butterflies. In recent years, they have planted milkweed in Centralia. “We’re trying to get that area designated as a monarch way station eventually,” Hughes said.  Most of the homes that once stood in the former borough are long gone. The town has been mostly vacant for almost 30 years.  At one time, Centralia had a population of 1,200. In 1962, officials in the borough started a fire to clean up a trash dump, but it ignited one of the coal seams that runs under the town. Since then, smoke has been seen coming out of fissures on the abandoned stretch of Route 61. Many residents moved out of the town, making it a “ghost town.” In 1992, the state condemned the remaining buildings and eliminated the zip code.  The event on April 17 also will include cleanup, as some people continue to use Centralia as an illegal dumping site. A request for volunteers was posted on the EPCAMR’s website and Facebook page.  Hughes said they have received an overwhelming response so far, with 100 volunteers signed up. There is now a waitlist to volunteer. Hughes is encouraged that so many people want to help.  “We’ve cleaned up a lot of trash over the past seven years. We can now talk about the ecosystem and beautification,” Hughes said.\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'A new study on the effectiveness of the Apple Watch and iPhone as tools for measuring functional capacity in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been published by researchers at Stanford University.  The study, which involved 110 participants, found that the health-monitoring capabilities in these products could supplement or replace in-clinic tests for \"frailty\" in patients with CVD.  Frailty in this case is measured in terms of the distance a patient can travel in a six-minute walk. This is normally tested with a six-minute walk test (6MWT), and frailty was defined in the study \"as walking <300m on an in-clinic 6MWT.\"  The study found that an Apple Watch was able to accurately assess frailty with a specificity of 85 percent and sensitivity of 90 percent in a supervised, in-clinic test. But the potentially significant finding is that it was able to do the same accurately with a specificity of 60 percent and sensitivity of 83 percent in unsupervised, at-home tests.  The researchers therefore concluded that the Watch is accurate enough to replace the in-clinic tests in many circumstances. Here\\'s what the researchers\\' article says about the test results:  Under a supervised in-clinic setting, the smartphone and Apple Watch with the VascTrac app were able to accurately assess \"frailty\" with sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 85%. Outside the clinic in an unsupervised setting, the home-based 6MWT is 83% sensitive and 60% specific in assessing “frailty.” Passive data collected at home were nearly as accurate at predicting frailty on a clinic-based 6MWT as was a home-based 6MWT, with area under curve (AUC) of 0.643 and 0.704, respectively.  Advertisement And here is their conclusion:  While the benefits of telemedicine and remote monitoring—convenience, low cost, improved data quality—have been postulated for some time, the COVID-19 pandemic has made accelerated implementation a safety imperative. In this study, we showed that smart device-based measurements, including both a 6MWT and passively collected activity data, provide clinically accurate and meaningful insights about functional capacity in patients with CVD.  You can read the full paper at PLOS One. It\\'s important to note that while the study was conducted independently, it was funded by Apple. Also, the study has a small sample size, and the sample size did not include much demographic diversity.  Apple may have funded the study to assist in marketing or lobbying for the acceptance of an Apple Watch for this use case, or the company may have commissioned the study to tap the results to inform decisions about which health features to invest in for the Watch.  When the work for the study was done, researchers had to use an app called VascTrac to run the tests. But Apple has since added the 6MWT test as a built-in feature of watchOS, so an additional app would no longer be needed.  Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he sees wearables like the Watch as the future of the company in many ways, and many of the strides in innovation and adoption the company has achieved in recent years have been in that category. Studies like this help the company make the case that its products solve real-world problems.  That said, Apple\\'s claims on this front may not always pass scrutiny. For example, some doctors have raised concerns that the Watch\\'s attempts to identify atrial fibrillation do not adequately replace more robust testing and that the readings may lead to negative outcomes for patients if they are misused.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Apple has discontinued its original HomePod after four years. It says that it will continue to produce and focus on the HomePod mini, introduced last year. The larger HomePod offered a beefier sound space but the mini has been very well received and clearly accomplishes many of the duties that the larger version was tasked with. The sound is super solid (especially for the size) and it offers access to Siri, Apple’s assistant feature.  The original HomePod was a feat of audio engineering that Apple spent over five years developing. In order to accomplish its development, the team at Apple built out a full development center near its headquarters in Cupertino, with a world-class development environment with a dozen anechoic chambers, including one of the bigger anechoic chambers outside of academic use in the US. I visited the center before its release, noting that Apple took it the extra mile to get the incredibly complex series of tweeters and woofer that built its soundspace:  But slathered on top of that is a bunch of typically Apple extra-mile jelly. Apple says that its largest test chamber is one of the biggest in the US, on a pad, suspended from the outside world with nothing to pollute its tests of audio purity. Beyond testing for the acoustic qualities of the speaker, these chambers allowed Apple to burrow down to account for and mitigate the issues that typically arise from having a high excursion subwoofer in such a small cabinet. Going even further, there are smaller chambers that allow them to isolate the hum from electronic components (there is a computer on board after all) and make attempts to insulate and control that noise so it doesn’t show up in the final output.  I found it to be one of the best speakers ever made for the home when I reviewed it in 2018. From the booming base and well-shaped nature of the tweeter assembly inside; the cloth cover that was specially shaped to avoid interfering with sound quality in any way; the way that it sensed the way that audio was being shaped by walls and other obstructions and adjusted its output to compensate. It was the definition of ‘no effort spared’ in the speaker department.  The major gripe for the speaker at the time was the $349 price, which was at the top end of the home speaker market, especially those with embedded home assistants. A price drop to $299 mitigated that somewhat, but still put it at the top of the pricing umbrella for the class. Apple’s HomePod mini, launched last year, has been well received. Our Brian Heater said that it had ‘remarkably big sound’ for the $99 price.  Apple gave TechCrunch a statement about the discontinuation:  HomePod mini has been a hit since its debut last fall, offering customers amazing sound, an intelligent assistant, and smart home control all for just $99. We are focusing our efforts on HomePod mini. We are discontinuing the original HomePod, it will continue to be available while supplies last through the Apple Online Store, Apple Retail Stores, and Apple Authorized Resellers. Apple will provide HomePod customers with software updates and service and support through Apple Care.  Existing HomePods will continue to be sold but Apple’s website is already out of Space Gray. It will continue to provide support for existing HomePods. Apple seems to be betting on the mini going forward, which could point to their desire to fill every room with ‘good enough’ sound rather than to focus on the living room with ‘truly unbelievable’ sound. The HomePod itself never quite got to the level where it could act as a full home theater replacement, though paired in their multi-speaker configurations.  The HomePod research and production efforts will live on in some ways through Apple’s advanced audio rendering systems that led to things like Spatial Audio in AirPods. I quite enjoy the ones in my home and have yet to add any minis to the mix. Maybe a last minute hunt is in order.  Early Stage is the premier ‘how-to’ event for startup entrepreneurs and investors.

Like the one we wrote about a few weeks ago that discussed a way to remove the Macs’s trackpad and replace it with haptic outputs the new patent granted on 30 March 2021 seems to remove not just the trackpad, but the keyboard too!  The newly granted patent relates to a \"Configurable force-sensitive input structure for electronic devices\".  The patent seems to be designed to avoid the problem with mechanical keyboards, such as Apple experienced with the problematic butterfly mechanism keyboards that suffered sometimes unrectifiable faults when dust and debris was trapped under the keys.  In this patent the input area - where you’d normally find the keyboard and trackpad of a laptop - is a single contact metal surface. Under this surface are two layers into which input and other controls are built in.  A layer that yields to pressure could offer the user feedback on input and small translucent holes in the metal surface could allow buttons or borders to be displayed - and adapted to suit.  It is interesting that, according to the patent, the user can configure the input area himself. So instead of a keyboard, the entire surface could be used as a number keyboard or trackpad, for example.  Apple has a large number of patents on similar topics and it is possible this will never see the light of day. The company originally submitted this patent back in 2015.

       "  'text': 'Here in Hawai‘i, we think Filipino food is just adobo, pancit, lumpia. In the dessert realm, we might know a little more: halo halo, bibingka, pandesal, ensamada. Maybe. But how little I know about Filipino food, and the Philippines itself, is immediately obvious upon meeting Jo Soeung of Wow Baguio. From her small production kitchen in Chinatown, she hands me a jar of strawberry jam. She says Baguio City, where she’s from, is famous for its strawberries, which grow well in the cool mountainous climate, more akin to the Pacific Northwest than the tropical humidity I associate with the Philippines. Strawberries in the Philippines? I had no idea.  Soeung started Wow Baguio to give people a taste of her hometown, which in addition to strawberries, is known for its ube halaya, or jam (in particular, one that’s made by the Good Shepherd Convent since 1976). I try her ube jam, which is a vibrant purple and tastes purely of ube, with the consistency of mashed yams. Which is basically what it is—Soeung uses no artificial flavors nor coloring in her jam, unlike most ube treats—it’s just local ube, coconut cream and sugar. My favorite of her jams, though, is the coconut, creamy and lush like caramel. But give me any of Wow Baguio’s jams and fluffy pandesal, a soft, fluffy roll dusted in cornmeal, and I will eat them from morning to night.  SEE ALSO: Find Homestyle Filipino Food at Consuelo’s Kusina  Soeung is the fourth generation to continue the tradition of making and selling jams and cookies. “Wow Baguio reminds me of the simple things in life, and how my grandmother, from just selling in a market, was able to raise seven kids and five grandchildren because of these jams that she made,” Soeung says. “When I’m not doing this, I have my personal chef service—people book me to cook for them. But Wow Baguio is for me—a reminder to be always the kid at heart. Because I feel like nowadays, especially with what’s going on right now, the purest thing that we can do for ourselves is like, take me back to the childhood where I don’t have all of these thoughts right now, and all I can remember is all of this…” She gestures to the tray of sweets she’s laid out for me, a merienda, or afternoon snack, that includes coffee scented with cardamom and cinnamon, Filipino hot chocolate she made by frothing tablea (ground cacao) with water, yogurt made with macapuno (a soft jellylike coconut), ube and strawberry jam, and pandesal.  “I never thought that I might present this part of my life in a trade,” she says. She was originally a nurse in Seattle, where she moved as a teenager with her family. Then, at a part time hostess job at an Asian restaurant, she saw a chef work the wok. “You see the way he focuses on the wok on the fire, he’s just cooking fried rice, but why does this look so magical to me? What is going on?! It’s like a love scene from a Leonardo DiCaprio movie. I got like hot flashes.” She eventually enrolled in culinary school and worked in Seattle before coming to Hawai‘i for a stint as the chef de cuisine at the Grand Wailea Maui and then venturing out on her own.  SEE ALSO: Happy Veganuary: Revisiting Tane Vegan Izakaya in Honolulu  Now, in her personal chef business, she’s still able to express her heritage from time to time, as in her sauces of adobo and kinilaw (the Filipino version of ceviche), and she recently created a vegan version of an Igorot feast. She grew up amongst Igorots, the collective name for the indigenous tribes in the Cordilleras of northern Philippines. Whereas we usually associate Filipino flavors with fish sauce and shrimp paste and sour notes from vinegar or calamansi, Igorot cuisine is largely devoid of these, seasoning instead a mostly hunted and foraged diet with salt, ginger, tiny, intense chilies, and smoke.  “But why vegan?” I ask. Wow Baguio’s treats are all vegan, though as a private chef, she cooks for all eaters.  “I started being vegan when I was in Texas (for a chef event) and got bitten by the Lone Star tick,” she says. “It gave me an autoimmune disease and I can’t eat meat.”  “Wow, it’s like karma for meat-loving Texans.”  “This is karma for every time vegans came to restaurants where I worked and I told [the servers] to give them water and parsley.”  Jams $15 each, a dozen pandesal $18, Lola’s cookies $15.

Recap Tuesday\\'s episode of TheStreet Live with Jim Cramer and Katherine Ross in the video above and be sure to catch TheStreet Live every weekday at 10:30 a.m. ET:  What GameStop and AMC and Braveheart Have in Common  \"How can a company\\'s stock be hostage to its own shareholders to do the job that the company can\\'t?\" Asked Jim Cramer in his Real Money column on Tuesday morning. \"But that\\'s what happens when WallStreetBets took over the flow of certain stocks and made it clear that they were the bosses, not the company, not Wall Street analysts, not Wall Street professionals and, most important, not the short-sellers.\"  \"To me this method of buying does not represent anything remotely considered to be investing. Sure, it\\'s OK to care what your fellow shareholders might do. In fact, I have been deeply focused on knowing what your compadres might do. That\\'s because it\\'s vital to try to find out what an Archegos might do. For example, when I saw big trades before the market opened in Tencent (TME) and Baidu (BIDU) I thought something was wrong at the companies. Nope, that was Goldman Sachs (GS) shrewdly dumping the shares that Archegoes had in these names to protect their own balance sheet. Talk about important knowledge,\" he continued.  What to Do With Cruise Stocks Now?  \"For his second \"Executive Decision\" segment, Cramer also spoke with Frank Del Rio, president and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) - Get Report, the cruise line operator that finds itself locked in a battle with the CDC over the timing and protocols needed to resume sailing. Shares of Norwegian rose 7.1% Monday after the company offered up its latest round of proposals for safe operations,\" wrote TheStreet\\'s Scott Rutt in his Mad Money recap.  \"Del Rio said he was \"deeply disappointed\" by the latest guidance from the CDC. \"It\\'s time to start cruising again,\" he said. The cruise lines have been forbidden from sailing for 17 months and there is still seemingly no end in sight,\" he continued.  Credit Suisse Books $4.7 Billion Hit Following Archegos Collapse  Credit Suisse CS announced that the \"significant\" hit that it had warned about following the Archegos collapse will lead to a $4.7 billion writedown.  TheStreet\\'s Martin Baccardax reported that Credit Suisse said it will likely report a pre-tax loss of 900 million Swiss francs ($960 million) , a figure that includes a charge of 4.4 billion Swiss francs tied to what it called \"the failure by a US-based hedge fund to meet its margin commitments.  \"The significant loss in our Prime Services business relating to the failure of a US-based hedge fund is unacceptable,\" said CEO Thomas Gottstein in a statement. \"In combination with the recent issues around the supply chain finance funds, I recognize that these cases have caused significant concern amongst all our stakeholders.\"  Hear what Jim Cramer is only telling members of his Action Alerts PLUS investing club in Tuesday’s Daily Rundown.'},\n",

Whether you’re into jazz, pop music, or dance and RnB, you’ll find it with an Apple Music subscription.  Although some reports pit Apple Music ahead of Spotify in key markets such as the United States, the company is facing stiff competition from other players like TIDAL, Amazon Music, and YouTube Music, and some are wondering whether now is the time to differentiate and ensure that Apple Music can weather the storms in the years ahead and keep its customers.  Like buying an iPhone or a new computer, music streaming subscriptions are easy to cancel or drop – and many are turning to Spotify because of its exclusive podcasts and, what some say as a superior user experience, with more control, flexibility, and options than Apple.  As well as updating the user interface to ensure customers remain happy, Apple has another option: to offer high-fidelity sound for those looking for a premium listening experience.  Although Apple has never disclosed the bitrate its songs are streaming at, we do know that songs that are stored in the iCloud Library are 256kbps AAC. TIDAL HiFi, on the other hand, offers a lossless listening experience at 1411kbps, whilst its new TIDAL Master tier offers an “authenticated and unbroken” experience at the highest possible resolution, streaming from 2304 to 9216kbps. That’s a significant jump over Apple Music and something the firm should consider.  Granted, streaming lossless music is more expensive – it requires more bandwidth – but Apple could introduce a new lossless tier to encourage TIDAL customers to make the jump.  There’s no word on when – or if – Apple will introduce such a tier, but we’ll update you if we hear more.  Check back soon for more news from AppleMagazine, every day.'},\n",

       "  'text': \"Apple Watch comes with a fall detection feature which is a security feature. When fall detection is enabled in Apple Watch, it will help you in connecting with emergency services and also send a message to your emergency contacts. If Apple Watch senses a hard fall, and you stay immobile for about a minute, it will place a call to emergency services automatically.  If you have entered your age while setting up your Apple Watch or in the Health app, and you are of the age 55 years or above, this feature is turned on by default. However, if you are 18 years and older, still you can choose to turn on the fall detection feature on Apple Watch SE and Apple Watch Series 4 and later by following these steps:  How to enable fall detection on Apple Watch  Step 1: Open the Settings app on your Apple Watch.  Step 2: Then, go to ‘SOS’,  Step 3: Tap on ‘fall detection’, then turn on ‘fall detection'.  Note: In case you turn off wrist detection, Apple Watch SE and Apple Watch Series 4 and later will not automatically make an emergency call even after it has sensed a hard impact fall.  Alternatively,  You can open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone,  Then, tap ‘my watch, and select ‘emergency SOS’.  Now, turn on ‘fall detection'.
